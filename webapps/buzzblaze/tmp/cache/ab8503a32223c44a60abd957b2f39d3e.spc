<p>One of the most attractive parts about blogging as a profession for me is the independence and flexibility that it brings.</p>
<p>I can work from anywhere that I can find an Internet connection. In fact, I don&#8217;t even need that at all times—I just need some kind of device to capture the content that I produce (something to type on, a camera, and/or a microphone).</p>
<p>This flexibility, and the opportunity to be location-independent, are wonderful things. They&#8217;ve meant I&#8217;m able to travel and work from the road; they&#8217;ve enabled me to be quite hands-on with my family (particularly useful when your kids are toddlers!), and they&#8217;ve also cut down the dreaded commute that I used to have to do when I worked a &#8220;real&#8221; job.</p>
<p>The other great thing about this type of work—combined with the ever-increasing array of portable computing gadgets that are around—is that from day to day, I&#8217;m able to work in all kinds of locations. This variety can be both fun and make life a little more interesting, but it can also help stimulate all kinds of creativity.</p>
<p>Someone asked recently what were my favorite places to blog from. Here&#8217;s what I said (and I&#8217;d love to hear your favorites below):</p>
<h2>1. Cafes</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cafes.jpg" alt="cafes.jpeg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>The combination of coffee, a computer, and the white noise of those around me is a very productive mix for me. I spend at least four mornings a week in my local cafe, just a short stroll from our front door. The staff greet me with &#8216;Blogger dude!&#8221; and bring me my drink of choice (a skinny latte with one sugar) without needing to be asked (and a second one 30 minutes later, or on the nod of the head—whichever comes first!). They even installed WiFi just for me.</p>
<p>Other patrons ask how I ever get anything done with all the noise, but for me it&#8217;s a strangely productive place where I find myself getting lost in my work. I also enjoy the fact that there are others around—snippets of overheard conversation or interactions with others in the cafe often produce ideas, stimulate blog posts, and even generate product ideas.</p>
<h2>2. Shopping centers (the mall)</h2>
<p>A variation on the cafe approach has been a semi-regular visit to a local shopping center or mall. The one I go to is among the biggest in Melbourne, and has a great range of cafes, a food court, and several hundred shops—including an Apple store. I enjoy working there partly for similar reasons to those mentioned above (white noise, coffee, etc.), but also because I find the environment quite stimulating for ideas.</p>
<p>I have a little routine that I use: an hour in one cafe; a 15-minute stroll through the shops, where I get all kinds of marketing ideas; an hour in a second cafe; another stroll through shops; then I settle down in the food court or a resautrant for lunch. The combination of all this is surprisingly productive (and I keep the Apple store in business with my regular stop-offs there).</p>
<h2>3. The library</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/library.jpg" alt="library.jpeg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get there as much as I used to since we moved further away from the city, but I always found the big library in the center of Melbourne to be an inspiring place to work, and I used to head there at least once a month. I found just being in a place where others were working and reading used to help me still myself and focus.</p>
<p>Having a vast array of books, magazines, and newspapers on hand for little breaks was also quite stimulating, but the real treat for me is the reading room pictured above, which is just an inspiring place to hang out.</p>
<h2>4. Flying</h2>
<p>One of the most memorable work sessions that I&#8217;ve ever had was on a recent flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles. While I never used to enjoy that flight (14 hours cramped up next to a stranger with not much to do? Not fun!), the last few times I&#8217;ve flown, I&#8217;ve found myself being particularly productive</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the altitude or the oxygen they pump around the plane (do they do that?) but I often get a lot done flying. This could also partly be because this is one of the few times in my life that I&#8217;m disconnected from the Web (those international flights don&#8217;t have WiFi yet). It might also be because I&#8217;m traveling to and from conferences that I find to be stimulating experiences.</p>
<h2>5. On the couch</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/couch.jpg" alt="couch.jpeg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Most weeknights you can find me sitting in our lounge room, next to my wife, on the couch, in front of the TV, blogging. I&#8217;m not sure how much of the TV I actually watch, but I find the experience to be a good way to wind down at the end of a day.</p>
<p>There are times where my wife needs to tell me to put the computer down so we can connect (although she often sits there surfing too), but all in all it&#8217;s usually a reasonably productive time. I tend to use it mainly for admin-type tasks—email, social media, comment moderation, etc.—rather than creative ones, but occasionally I&#8217;ll find that something from the TV also stimulates ideas for my work.</p>
<h2>6. My desk and office</h2>
<p>This is where I do the bulk of my blogging. While I like to get out of the house in the morning to write (mornings are generally more about writing content and creative tasks), I spend the bulk of my afternoons in my home office. This is where I create multi-media content, do interviews, take calls, and do most of the admin and editing tasks that I do.</p>
<p>I did a <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/01/11/problogger-hq-20/">tour of my office a few years back</a>—not a lot has changed in terms of layout, although I now mainly work from a laptop rather than the desktop computer.</p>
<h2>What about you?</h2>
<p>Where do you spend most of your time blogging? Which places do you enjoy blogging the most? Do you find different places are better for certain tasks more than others? Interested in your thoughts.</p>

<p>Facebook Fan pages are swiftly becoming a standard extension to blogs&#8217; brands and messages. This is a highly effective form of engaging with your target market and building a community around your brand.</p>
<p>If you focus on making your Fan page your homepage for the social web, you can create a page that serves as your mini-hub. Then use it as your platform to connect on a deeper level.</p>
<h2>Today&#8217;s currency is engagement</h2>
<p>People like to socialize with, and ultimately do business with, people they like and trust. So it&#8217;s very important that you&#8217;re actively engaging with your followers and they are engaging with you—hence the word &#8220;social&#8221;. That&#8217;s how you build strong and rewarding relationships.</p>
<p>From personal experience, by building an engaged and interactive community through our own travel blog&#8217;s fan page, our community member numbers grow every day. And although ours may not have as many fans as some other Fan pages, it does have a great deal more engagement, which is not only important to us, but important to Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook rewards you for building relationships. The degree to which you engage with your fans, and how much they interact with you, determines <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-10-18/the-facebook-news-feed-how-it-works-the-10-biggest-secrets/" target="_blank">whether your status updates show in your fans&#8217; news feeds.</a></p>
<h2>Strive for social success first, not marketing success</h2>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/12/16/the-5-critical-errors-most-people-make-when-they-start-using-social-media-for-business-2/" target="_blank"> five critical errors most people make when they start using social media</a> for business.</p>
<p>The secret to our success has been very simple. We made the intention for our Fan page to build an engaged community and start conversations. We wanted to create a place where those within our travel community can meet for some socializing and fun, not just get travel tips and information. Our intention is <em>not</em> to use our Fan page purely as a marketing tool.</p>
<p>Although we know it&#8217;s a highly effective tool, we do not build our fan page community based on this. If your intention is just to use your page as a tool to promote your products, that will clearly come through, and your success with Facebook will be limited.</p>
<p>Think of those who are most successful in your niche. I bet most of them began blogging by building their brand and a community first, and any monetization came later. First, build a passionate community based around social interaction and sharing. Any monetary rewards will come naturally later on.</p>
<h2>Make your Fan page a party</h2>
<p>We approach our Fan page strategy as if we were hosting guests at a party. For us to remove all thoughts of the page being a marketing tool, we had to think of it as the type of place we&#8217;d like to hang out. So our intention was to make our fan page more like a party. We love to socialize, and have never been shy in hosting parties in real life in any of the countries we&#8217;ve lived in. After all, isn&#8217;t that what the &#8220;social&#8221; part of social media is all about?</p>
<h3>We invite and welcome</h3>
<p>First of all, we invite and we welcome visitors. No one will come to your party if you don&#8217;t first invite them. We have clear invitations set up on our blog and all our other online platforms. And when our new guests arrive, we warmly welcome them in. We tag and give a shout out by video to every 100th guest. And we also have a &#8220;Fan of the Month,&#8221; which is the person who has contributed the most to the community in that time.</p>
<h3>We interact and respond</h3>
<p>This is our biggest recommendation for keeping social media &#8220;social.&#8221; How long would your party last if you didn&#8217;t talk to your guests? Or worse still, if they spoke to you and you ignored them? We do not ignore our guests. We respond to every comment left on our Fan page. Yes, it takes work, but we value our community members and suggest you value yours. Fostering a community involves a strong leader who supports, encourages, recognizes, and inspires.</p>
<p>Managing fan comments has become much easier since we started using a great free app called  <a href="http://www.hyperalerts.no/" target="_blank">Hyper Alerts</a>.</p>
<h3>We ask questions and share</h3>
<p>To be interesting, you must be interested. The best way to get to know new people is to ask questions. Remember, people like to talk about themselves, so let them. Don&#8217;t make the conversation all about you, what you&#8217;re doing, and your opinion.</p>
<p>Ask questions as a way to get your fans to share, to stimulate conversation, and to give advice. A lot of people won&#8217;t open up initially if they don&#8217;t feel like someone wants to listen or will respond. Be the listener and when your guests do answer the question and share, be the responder. Continue to ask questions throughout the conversation to encourage a more in-depth discussion.</p>
<p>At least once a month, we have a status update that runs something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead and introduce yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where are you from?</li>
<li>Where are you currently?</li>
<li>What is your favorite travel destination?</li>
<li>Can we help you with anything?&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>This gets people to open up and feel welcomed. Sharing helps others to make new connections and form bonds. Simply through this particular update, community members become aware of others&#8217; geographical locations and special interests, and can connect more directly. Sharing also shows that you are interested in and care about your fans. We also make an effort to share other people&#8217;s articles, videos, and blog sites through our Fan page.</p>
<p>Every Friday we have &#8220;Post Your URL Day,&#8221; when we encourage other travel bloggers to post their URLs and a three-line description under their status updates. From the URLs posted, we randomly choose a winner to do a featured interview on.</p>
<h3>We say it with photos</h3>
<p>Pictures really do tell a thousand words. Being in the travel industry, we find there&#8217;s no better way to inspire others and stir emotion than through travel photos. So we post a daily travel photo of a destination we have personally visited.</p>
<p>We also post random photos from our day-to-day lives. That way, our community members get a behind-the-scenes look into our life that creates a deeper connection.</p>
<p>People love to look at others&#8217; personal photos, and Facebook is <em>great</em> for that. And did you know that   <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/12/13/use-photos-to-stand-out-in-the-facebook-news-feed/ " target="_blank">using photos to stand out in the Facebook news feed</a> carries more weight than text updates when it comes to your <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/22/facebook-edgerank/" target="_blank">Facebook EdgeRank Score</a>?</p>
<h3>We play games</h3>
<p>Everybody loves a good game—especially if they&#8217;re at a party and there are a few beers involved! There won&#8217;t be beers at your Fan page party, but you can still have a good time. We run a &#8220;Where in the World&#8221; game, where we upload a travel photo from somewhere in the world, and our fans have to guess the location. This stirs interaction and creates a fun vibe.</p>
<p>We also have &#8220;Happy Hour&#8221; once a week, where we encourage our fans to post a link to their favorite blog, website, or resource on the Web. Take some time to think of games you can play on your Fan page that relate to your niche and encourage participation.</p>
<h3>We run competitions</h3>
<p>Once you have enough fans engaged and interacting at your party, consider introducing competitions with prizes to let them know you appreciate them. We run photo contests every second month with a different photo theme which relates in some way to our prize. Last month&#8217;s prize was a backpack sponsored by Kelty, and the photo theme was National Parks. Fans get to vote on the best photo, and the top five are then sent to the sponsoring company, which selects the ultimate winner. Competitions like this are a win-win for you and your sponsor, who gets exposure to a new audience.</p>
<h2>New ideas for a fantastic fan page party</h2>
<p>Keep thinking of new ways to make your Fan page—and party—better. Don&#8217;t initially approach Facebook asking, &#8220;How am I going to use this as a monetization tool?&#8221; Instead, ask &#8220;How am I going to make this the fun place to hang out?&#8221; That&#8217;s the way to create an engaged community.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just create a Fan page, create an experience. Get this right, and the rest will naturally follow.</p>
<p>How much of a community are you building around your brand on Facebook?</p>

<p>“I think you need to rewrite that last paragraph,” she said.  “And this time, maybe try to be just a little more concise.”</p>
<p>She said it gently.  Yet the words stung.  She could tell I was a little hurt, so she tried to smooth it over.</p>
<p>“I really like this blog post. I think it is going to be well received by our readers.”  I patiently waited for the “but.”  And after a moment or two it came.</p>
<p>“But … the only thing is (and please don’t be upset) maybe you should also work a little more on the title before hitting the Publish button.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a new criticism and I did not expect it.  Again it hurt.  I do not particularly like being edited, by anyone.  “Anything else?” I asked with more than a hint of sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Yeah, when you’re done with that can you help me set the table? Dinner is almost ready.”</p>
<p>So goes life when you blog as a husband/wife team.</p>
<p>Note that I&#8217;ll use the term “spouse” in this post, but this word is being used to mean any type of relationship.</p>
<h2>Advantages of blogging as a husband/wife team</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to be said for blogging in partnership with your spouse.</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>The one resource all bloggers can agree they need more of is time. Unfortunately it&#8217;s also the most finite of resources.  Partnering up with at least one other co-blogger is great because you can, in theory, accomplish twice the amount of work. For example, while one of you is working on the creative portion of your blog, your co-blogger can work on blog promotion.</p>
<p>When you co-blog with your spouse, as I do, it&#8217;s even easier to communicate. You&#8217;re probably always together anyway, so even dinner can become an impromptu brainstorming session.</p>
<h3>Not feeling guilty about the blogging &#8220;time suck&#8221;</h3>
<p>Another advantage of co-blogging with your spouse is that it&#8217;s a great way to spend a lot of time on your blogging hobby without feeling like you are alienating your family. I feared in the beginning that my wife would start to resent my blog, but instead I turned her into a blogging co-conspirator.</p>
<h3>Honest feedback and criticism</h3>
<p>My wife and I can be (sometimes brutally) honest with our criticisms with one another because we have been together for years.  We are in sync and understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses.  I understand that she finds the creative process more engaging than blog promotion, so I try to pull more weight with promotion and online networking.</p>
<p>Much like real life, as bloggers your spouse and you will tend to form a complete unit, whereby you can as a team rise well above the level of skill and/or success that you could ever hope to achieve individually.</p>
<h3>Improving your blog&#8217;s voice and perspective</h3>
<p>Our blog has brought us closer together and we can sometimes incorporate our marital dynamic subtly into our blog. We have blog “debates” or use in-jokes that are, hopefully endearing to our audience and different from what they generally read in most other personal finance blogs.</p>
<p>You can leverage your relationship to maybe create a more unique and valuable experience for your audience.</p>
<h3>Motivational benefits</h3>
<p>Like an exercise program, a book club, or a diet, it can be very motivational to have a blogging partner—someone who can push you, and keep you inspired and working towards the ultimate goals of your blog. It&#8217;s also helpful if that person is someone you do not want to let down.</p>
<p>There are nights when I don&#8217;t want to follow our posting schedule, but then I think about how we&#8217;re a team. Also, having someone else around to pull half the weight means that I have not yet come close to burnout, despite the fact that we both have demanding day jobs and keep a daily posting schedule.</p>
<h2>Challenges of blogging as a husband/wife team</h3>
<p>Like any partnership, blogging with your spouse has its challenges.</p>
<h3>Creative control issues</h3>
<p>You need look no further than examples of various movie star couples that have broken up after working together on a movie project than to know that working with your spouse is not without its potential traps.</p>
<p>For some, the whole purpose of starting a blog may be to escape a job or family, or to simply have something all their own.  Once you partner up with a co-blogger, whether the co-blogger is a friend, a stranger, or your spouse, you will no longer possess 100% creative control over the blog.</p>
<p>For example, once I wrote a post that was, in hindsight, really quite weak.  It was weak because it was a subject only I really cared about, and it was outside the scope of our niche.  My wife pointed this out, and I have to admit I begrudged it for a little bit, even though I knew deep down she was right. The opposite scenario has occurred as well. This creative collaboration can benefit the blog, but it&#8217;s still a challenge for the individuals involved.</p>
<h3>The stronger personality may take over</h3>
<p>This is the Fight Club Rule in effect.  Essentially, and as with the rest of your marriage (or in any relationship, really), the stronger party may hijack creative control, and thus alter the intended direction of your blog.</p>
<p>This is not an issue that affects us personally, but we definitely have some friends in couples who could not, in our opinion, function as a 50/50 blogging team.  This is particularly devastating if the less visionary or talented partner is the one who is more desirous of control.</p>
<h3>Fear of honest criticism</h3>
<p>I realize I previously listed open communication and honesty as a likely result of blogging with your spouse, but I can also imagine scenarios where even married couples are too nice to be honest about whether material is right for their blog or not—and the kind of friction that might result.</p>
<h3>Jealousy</h3>
<p>There have been times when I&#8217;ve been jealous of one of my wife’s posts going viral or getting more comments—particularly if my posts have been in a prolonged slump.  It is only normal to feel a twinge of envy under such a scenario, and it is one of the possible occupational hazards of working with any partner on a blog.</p>
<h3>The blog becomes consuming</h3>
<p>I fear I have the blogging addiction much worse than my wife does.  I am sure there are times when she wishes we could just relax without worrying about furthering the blog. The solution, of course, is to set some boundaries.  That said, if you figure out how to properly establish such boundaries, please let me know, so I can try to establish some as well!  My wife would be forever indebted to you, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<h2>Are two heads better than one?</h2>
<p>The important thing, of course, is to have fun and to allow the co-blogging experience to bring you together as a couple.  The major thing to avoid is burnout induced from working together.  If you ever need a reminder of what not to do, turn to this post or, if you&#8217;re desperate, watch the movie “The Getaway” starring Alec Baldwin and his ex-wife, Kim Basinger.</p>
<p>If you establish the right boundaries and you both find a passion for blogging, then your co-blogging experience can be both beneficial to your readers and to your marriage.</p>
<p>Have you ever co-blogged?  What was your experience like? If you haven&#8217;t co-blogged with a spouse, would you consider doing so?  I look forward to reading your responses.</p>

<p>Oh, it’s a love/hate relationship with New Year’s Resolutions, isn’t it? If you’re feeling a bit dismayed at your lack of resolution to blog better in 2011, you’re not alone. But I’m here to help.</p>
<p>How can you get that resolution back on track?</p>
<h2>1. Revisit your plan</h2>
<p>What did you decide to do this year? Blog more often, guest post more often, add sponsors, or get involved in the comments? You can pick yourself back up again. It’s only February, and there’s a lot of 2011 left.</p>
<p>So, where did you lose heart? What made you trip? Was your goal too much? Did you set too high of a standard? Did the new season of American Idol suck you back in? (Steve Tyler is like a train wreck; you just can’t look away! His jowls. Randy’s shoes! Yeah, I got sucked in.)</p>
<h2>2. Reconfigure the plan</h2>
<p>So, how can you get back to it? Do you need some more soul-searching? Do you need to research? Write a few emails that you’ve been avoiding? Ask the hard questions and push past the block. <em>You can do it!</em></p>
<h2>3. Schedule yourself into the future</h2>
<p>How do you intend to accomplish this plan for your blog? Set up a schedule. If you have to write your blog posts at Starbucks to feel like you’ve made it, then do it. The carrot and stick method works. Bait yourself and get a reward.</p>
<h2>4. Find your resources</h2>
<p>Whether you’re using Darren’s book or blogging ebooks to build a better blog in 2011, dig them out from wherever you’ve stashed them, and <em>use them</em>. Set limits on how much you’re going to do each day, but do something each day. Don’t we all just work better when we stick with it? Little by little, we’ll eat that elephant.</p>
<h2>5. Keep track of your progress</h2>
<p>Believe me, you keep at this blogging thing in 2011, and by 2012, you’ll want to look back and see how far you’ve come. Keep a blog journal and note how many things you attempted, what did work, and what didn’t. This is not a competition. This is a learning process.</p>
<p>Twelve months is a long time. Even if you’ve dropped the ball and really got off track in the past weeks, that doesn’t mean you can’t get back to the top of the pile in the next five weeks. Give yourself a break, sip the latte, and go to it!</p>

<p>What separates your blog from thousands of others in your niche? What are you doing that&#8217;s different? Why would people prefer your blog over others?</p>
<p>Like most writers, that question may make you freeze for a minute. You can feel your insides going numb. Your face starts turning green.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s different about you? Man. You can&#8217;t think of anything right off the bat. You&#8217;ve lived with yourself for a long time, and you&#8217;re used to it. You can&#8217;t imagine what makes you different from everyone else. You&#8217;re just an average guy. </p>
<p>After thinking for a bit, you come up with this answer:</p>
<p>The only thing that distinguishes you from everyone else is your personality. It&#8217;s your most valuable asset. There&#8217;s nobody else quite like you. If you write with personality, people will listen to what you have to say.</p>
<p>This makes sense. You begin feeling better. All you have to do is relax and be you, and everything will be okay. </p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a problem: nobody cares about who you are.</p>
<h2>Everybody&#8217;s unique</h2>
<p>There are millions of bloggers, and every one of them has a personality. Sure, your personality <em>will</em> separate you from other people, but that&#8217;s not enough. Everybody&#8217;s unique. So if you want people to read your blog, you&#8217;re going to have to have more than just personality.</p>
<p>This is a huge blow to the ego. It&#8217;s very hard to accept. By nature, you imagine that people value what you have to say. You&#8217;re more important than they are, and they recognize that.</p>
<p>I see this happen all the time in the visual arts. An amateur artist thinks their self-taught, self-expressive painting is every bit the masterpiece of a Rembrandt or Bierstadt. The artist refuses to study formal technique because he or she is afraid it&#8217;ll ruin his or her &#8220;touch&#8221;—the artistic personality. </p>
<h2>Teach, or die</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s one thing your blog can&#8217;t live without. And that&#8217;s teaching.</p>
<p>Nobody cares who you are, but they love to surf the Internet and learn things. If you&#8217;re giving away useful content that creates value for others, they&#8217;ll start showing interest in you.</p>
<p>People care about you in as much as you help them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tough to learn, but it&#8217;s true. People have the same ego problem you have. Learn to harness that, and you&#8217;ll start getting attention. The main purpose of blogging is to give your audience information they didn&#8217;t know. If your blog doesn&#8217;t teach, it won&#8217;t survive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide what your blog is all about.</li>
<li>Choose very specific topics within that niche</li>
<li>Write thorough, two-hour posts that explore these topics, one at a time.</li>
<li>Publish consistently. Don&#8217;t publish something unless it&#8217;s the best thing you&#8217;ve ever written. This means you&#8217;ll either be deleting a lot of drafts, or you&#8217;ll be spending entire days revising your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you do this, don&#8217;t worry about how you come across to others. Don&#8217;t put on a front. Just teach. And teach with passion. If you have a personality, it&#8217;ll start showing naturally.</p>
<p>Picture that starving artist. After a few years&#8217; frustration, he or she decides they need formal training after all. They take workshops from today&#8217;s masters. Eventually, their technique improves and they paint professionally. Does the artist still have a unique, personal style? Sure. But this time, it&#8217;s professional.</p>
<p>True, some of the artist&#8217;s original &#8220;touch&#8221; is gone. But looking back, he or she realizes that they&#8217;ve mistaken &#8220;touch&#8221; for awkward unprofessionalism. Now, the artist&#8217;s glad he or she lost that touch. It was horrible.</p>
<p>If your blog is going to live, you&#8217;re going to have to teach. If all you ever do is be personable, it&#8217;s going to die. Teach or die. It&#8217;s your choice. Your blog can live without you, but it can&#8217;t live without teaching.</p>
<p>Do you teach on your blog? How important is learning for your readers?</p>

<p>What if I said you&#8217;re only as good as the blogs you follow?  Maybe that’s not completely true for everyone, but I’m willing to bet all the A-listers have several blogs they check out every day.</p>
<p>I think there are basically two types of blogs you should follow.</p>
<h2>Type 1: Blogging blogs</h2>
<p>I know I’m preaching to the choir here, but I believe every blogger should keep an eye on several pro blogs in the field—whether they&#8217;re on making money or SEO tips, etc). Why?  Here are three reasons:</p>
<h3>1. Game-changer posts</h3>
<p>Every once in a while, I’ll run across a post that radically impacts my blogging from that point forward.  One example would be a post I read here that explained <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/06/20/simple-changes-doubled-my-adsense-revenue">how to optimize the position of ads</a>. Following that advice greatly improved the profits I made through both Adsense and affiliate banners. I don’t find these high-impact posts every day, but they easily make up for the effort I spend following the blogs I read.</p>
<h3>2.  Motivation</h3>
<p>I wasn’t even sure you <em>could</em> make money with blogging when I first started.  It’s hard to keep posting every day when you aren’t even sure there&#8217;s a possibility of financial reward for your efforts.  Following the pro bloggers gave me the encouragement I needed to keep going, even when profits were slow (or non-existent).   It also helped me to have realistic expectations and patience.  Building a good blog takes work and determination; never underestimate the power of motivation.</p>
<h3>3. SEO tips</h3>
<p>I was completely clueless about SEO in my early blogging days.  I still don’t consider myself an expert—not by a long shot.  I also don’t obsess over SEO.  Having said all this, I needed to learn how to work with search engines—best SEO practices, so to speak.   I learned most of what I know from reading what other bloggers had to say.</p>
<p>I follow about 17 blogs through feeds on my Google page.  Do I read every post on every blog?  No.  I just keep an eye on them and click any titles that get my attention. Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t overanalyze them. At some point you just need to shut up and blog.  Don’t try to follow every single bit of advice you read—some of it may not apply to you, your niche, or your blog.  You’ll even run across contradictory advice if you follow the blogging niche long enough.  Just use what helps you and disregard what doesn’t.</li>
<li>Don’t snub the B-listers. Keep an eye out for up-and-coming bloggers who may not be well known yet.  Some of these guys really know their stuff and are more accessible than their A-list counterparts.  Some of my favorite blogs, in fact, are not nearly as popular as Problogger.net.  One example is <a href="http://seo-hacker.com">SEO-Hacker</a>, a blog created by one of my friends here in Asia.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Type 2: Niche blogs</h2>
<p>I mentioned that I follow several pro blogs through RSS feeds.  I also follow several blogs within the same niche as mine (fitness blogs).  Following blogs in your niche, or related niches, can help you in several ways:</p>
<h3>1. Potential income streams</h3>
<p>Your fellow bloggers can help you keep an eye on new ways of making money.  You may learn of a new product or service to promote by watching other blogs in your niche.  Most of us try to keep track of these opportunities through affiliate newsletters, but other bloggers can help you find even more opportunities.</p>
<h3>2. Trends within your niche</h3>
<p>Blogs within your niche will alert you to “hot topics” in your industry or specialization.  You may want to post your own two cents about those trends—there’s always a chance you’ll get ranked well in search engines on a topic that everyone&#8217;s talking about (and searching for).</p>
<p>This is especially helpful if you live outside the country that&#8217;s responsible for most of your traffic. I live in Asia, but most of my fitness blog’s traffic (and revenue) comes from North America.  It’s very beneficial for me to follow bloggers back in the States.</p>
<h3>3. Rebuttal posts</h3>
<p>Following other bloggers is also an opportunity to be a voice of dissent.  If you read a post you disagree with, you can give your own unique point of view on a particular topic within the niche.  This would likely be a post you would have never thought of if you weren’t watching the blogosphere in your niche.</p>
<p>The bottom line: watching blogs within my own niche gives me lots of new ideas for producing fresh, relevant, high-quality content.  I think it will do the same for you.</p>
<p>What should you keep in mind as you follow niche blogs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Be yourself.  Don’t just repeat what everyone else is saying.  Always try to find a way to stand out from the crowd.  Loyal readers want to hear what <em>you</em> have to say.</li>
<li>Do your homework.  Hopefully you’ll inspiration from other blogs, but be sure to do your own research.  You’ll need to go back to original sources and studies to check the accuracy of other bloggers.  You’ll also need to carefully look at products you choose to endorse—what’s right for one blogger may not be right for you (even if you are in the same niche).</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there other types of blogs that you consider essential reading? Share them in the comments.</p>

<p>Nearly  a year and a half into making small strides in one of the smallest  niches on the Internet—the MILblog (military blog) community—our traffic started going  up. We had one question.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Our  guess is that—in addition to some great guest posts—we started  writing better headlines. People want to read articles with great  headlines. From the very beginning, we knew we should  have been writing good headlines—it was one of the first tips we read.  So why did we avoid writing analytics-crushingly good headlines?</p>
<p>Because of the tabloids.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been at the check-out counter, looked over and seen the tabloids screaming, “Snooki Sex Tape!” What? Or, “Brad Leaves Angelina!” Double what!? “Obama is an Alien!”  Triple what! So you pick up the magazine, and none of that is in there.  Snooki just got drunk. Brad is on vacation. Obama is still human.  You’re understandably disappointed: you’ve fallen for the tabloids.</p>
<p>I  think bloggers do the same thing. In an ever busier, fuller  blogosphere, we battle one another with our headlines. We fight each  other to write gripping, sticky headlines, clawing over one another with  more outlandish declarations of greatness like, “The 10 Tips To  Guarantee Blogging Success” or “How to Make A Billion Dollars Blogging,  Today!” Bloggers are, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/quotes" target="_blank">in the words of Cmdr. “Stinger” Johnson</a>, writing checks their butts can’t cash.</p>
<p>And the average member of the public is sick of it. <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-february-4-2010/the-blogs-must-be-crazy" target="_blank">Even John Stewart has made fun of it</a>.</p>
<p>If  every post you have is turned up all the way, your readers will go  deaf. Take &#8220;Please RT,&#8221; for example. Asking your followers to retweet a post  will almost guarantee your tweets get more views. But if you “Please RT”  every other tweet, as opposed to just the occasional special tweet,  &#8220;please RT&#8221; loses its meaning. You’ll lose followers, or your tweets  will just get ignored.</p>
<p>So  when we started blogging, we wanted to avoid misleading headlines,  writing only straight-forward, descriptive titles. And it was boring.  Post titles like, “War Without Meaning” and “Rainbow” just don’t attract  readers. They aren’t creative or fun.</p>
<p>Every headline needs to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain honestly what is in the article.</li>
<li> Make you want to read that article.</li>
</ol>
<p>There  are boring headlines that aren&#8217;t honest, boring headlines that are  honest, exciting headlines that are dishonest, and exciting headlines  that are honest. If you don’t know which is the best, it’s the last one.</p>
<p>So we went from writing “Violence in context” to writing “<a href="http://onviolence.com/?e=294" target="_blank">Haters Want to Hate or: If You Haven’t Been to Afghanistan, Then F*** You Hippy and Get Off My Internets</a>.” That title is fun, ironic, and snarky; it was also our most popular post ever.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be ProBlogger if we didn’t offer tips on how to “crush” headlines, and we have ‘em:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid exclamation points, or titles that feel like they need exclamation points. Seriously. Calm down.</li>
<li>Avoid non-ironic hyperbole. It probably means your claiming something you can’t follow up on.</li>
<li>Put accuracy before excitement.  We still don’t <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbVKWCpNFhY" target="_blank">turn every headline up to eleven</a>, because some don’t need it. Accept this, and say what your post is about.</li>
<li>Embrace creative limitations. To paraphrase  Robert McKee, limitations force writers to be creative, to look for  novel solutions. So be honest, don’t overstate or over-claim. Then apply  the creativity to get a great title on that post.</li>
<li>Take five minutes on every post and brainstorm a better title.</li>
<li>Don’t use the word “Secret.” Because  guess what? There are no secrets to great writing/blogging/making  money/losing weight/whatever. It’s the Internet. Someone, somewhere already  posted that data. Which means it isn’t a secret. In the words of Darren  Rowse, “<a href="../archives/2011/01/18/secrets-to-making-money-online/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ProbloggerHelpingBloggersEarnMoney+%28ProBlogger%3A+Helping+Bloggers+Earn+Money%29" target="_blank">There is no secret and there’s no one way to do this</a>.”</li>
<li>Read <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/magnetic-headlines/%20" target="_blank">this series on headlines by Copyblogger</a>. It’s really good. &#8220;Many people feel that a great headline is bombastic and full of hyperbole, but that’s usually not the case.” <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/why-some-people-almost-always-write-great-post-titles/" target="_blank">Brian Clark writes</a>.  “If people don’t believe you can deliver on your promise, they won’t  bother reading further, and your over-the-top headline fails.&#8221;</li>
<li>Be funny. If you’re funny. Otherwise, avoid it.</li>
</ol>
<p>What other headline tips can you add to this list?</p>
<p><em>Eric Cummings and Michael Cummings write for “<a href="http://www.onviolence.com/" target="_blank">On Violence</a>,” a blog on military and foreign affairs, art and violence written by two brothers; one a soldier and the other a pacifist.</em></p>

<h3>Can blogging be used to help others?</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/index.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="index.jpeg" align=right />However I&#8217;ve always wanted blogging to be more than just good to me. I want it to benefit others, too.</p>
<p>The most obvious people I want it to benefit are those who read the blogs I publish. This is why pretty much everything I do has a &#8220;how to&#8221; or &#8220;advice&#8221; spin on it.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting things that happens to me each day is being thanked for achieving that goal—helping people improve in some area of their life.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;ve always wanted blogging to be even more than that. Over the last few years, I&#8217;ve often found myself wondering how it could be used to make the world a better place in some bigger way.</p>
<p>With the opportunity to communicate to over 4 million people a month, surely I can find a way to do that.</p>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tanzania.png" alt="tanzania.png" width="300" height="287" /></p>
<h3>The Tanzanian experiment</h3>
<p>Next Thursday I&#8217;m going to experiment with doing just that—and I&#8217;d love you to join me.</p>
<p>On 25 February, I&#8217;m jumping on a plane (well, a series of them) for Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, East Africa.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be in the country for one week, to spend time observing—and reporting back to my social network on—an amazing project called <strong><a href="http://www.ccbrt.or.tz/">Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation</a> in Tanzania</strong> (CCBRT). It&#8217;s a project of CBM, an international disability and development organization.</p>
<p>The trip is being organized by CBM Australia (<a href="https://www.cbm.org.au/content/what-we-do/travel-blog-tanzania">you can read more about it here</a>) with the goal of raising awareness of the issues that are faced every day by people with disabilities in developing countries.</p>
<p>The work that they do is amazing.</p>
<p>Last year alone, they performed over 10,530 surgeries and helped improve the lives of around 120,000 people with disabilities and their carers.</p>
<p>Their work focuses upon many areas, including working with sight-related disabilities, club foot, cleft lip/palate, and maternal health (among others).</p>
<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ccbrt_portrait.jpg" alt="ccbrt_portrait.jpeg" width="267" height="370" /> Having spent time visiting a number of other projects in developing countries over the years, I know that this trip will be confronting. But I&#8217;m excited by the opportunity at hand to both be personally impacted by what I see, and to share the journey with you.</p>
<p>Throughout the week in Tanzania, I&#8217;ll be sharing what I see via blog posts, videos, and Tweets. We&#8217;ll be focusing mainly upon some the hospital&#8217;s work with maternal health issues (mainly fistula) and tracking some of the stories of the people that we meet.</p>
<p>This trip is not a money grab. The intent isn&#8217;t to create daily calls for you to donate. I&#8217;m sure CBM wouldn&#8217;t say no to donations (in fact, they&#8217;d go a long way to change lives), but my intent with this trip is to share stories, highlight needs, and show what an amazing organization and its people are doing to meet the needs around them.</p>
<p>My hope is that we&#8217;ll all come away from the experience with a better awareness of the issues, and the motivation to do something to make the world a better place (whether that be by supporting the work of CBM, or supporting another need you know of).</p>
<h3>How can you join this trip?</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/index-1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="index-1.jpeg" align=right />The bulk of the blogging that I&#8217;ll be doing while away will be on <a href="http://theblog.cbm.org.au/">CBM&#8217;s blog</a> (there isn&#8217;t much there yet, but we&#8217;ll be adding to it and redoing to the template significantly in the coming days). I&#8217;ll be adding posts, videos, and images during the week that I&#8217;m on the ground, and in the weeks that follow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably do an update or two here on ProBlogger also, but I&#8217;m aware that this blog is about blogging and not Tanzania or issues facing Developing Countries, so we&#8217;ll keep it largely on <a href="http://theblog.cbm.org.au/">CBM&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to get those updates please <a href="http://theblog.cbm.org.au/?feed=rss2">subscribe to their blog here</a>.</p>
<p>You can also follow the journey on Twitter by following <a href="http://twitter.com/cbmaustralia">CBM&#8217;s Twitter account</a>. I&#8217;ll be making updates on that and also, from time to time, on the <a href="http://twitter.com/problogger">ProBlogger Twitter account</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly &#8211; you can support this project by sharing news of it and the content we produce while in Tanzania. Please consider passing on the links to stories we share and helping word spread further about what we&#8217;re up to. Thanks!</p>

<p>After  almost three years of blogging, and about the same time spent discovering  my addiction to graphic design, I’ve come to realize that both of my  passion go hand in hand. Blogging and design is a match made in  heaven. And my favorite project to work on? Logos, of course.</p>
<p>Sure,  I’ve made designs for both online and offline business,  but when a blogger knocks at my mail box, I give them special priority.  That’s because, in truth, designing a blog logo is one of the trickiest  things to do. Of course there would always be clients who’re easy to deal  with and just give me free reign in creating the design (not  recommended!), but more often than not, bloggers are particularly  nitpicky (as you should be) at every step in the process. And I don’t blame  them. I&#8217;ve been there, done that—I actually used my previous blog as a  guinea pig for countless logo experiments.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to cover all the bases with regards to designing a blog logo—from its importance to a blog, to the process of creating your own. Even if you’re already happy with the logo you have right now, who knows? Within the next few months or years, you might revamp your blog or create a new blog altogether—and then, this guide ought to be useful.</p>
<h2>What’s the big deal with a blog logo?</h2>
<p>I know a lot of non-believers out there. These bloggers do away with logos and rely on other branding techniques such as their name as a brand (e.g. the blogs of Seth Godin and Matt Cutts). These cases are exceptions to the rule. If you are Matt Cutts or Seth Godin, would you even need a logo to begin with? In reality, the blogosphere is split on this issue. While some bloggers consider their own logo a requirement for branding, for others, it doesn’t really add any value.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I think it’s a matter of personal choice whether or not you think a logo is something you want on your blog. But eventually, most bloggers realize they need to have one to help build their blogs and their reputations, for a number of reasons:</p>
<h3>Branding</h3>
<p>Among the sea of blogs out there, being noticed can be a challenge—especially for new blogs. And it won’t make it any easier if you just leave your blog’s name in plain text as your header. A logo is also useful once you start developing products and services, as using a logo in your ebook or videos, for example, looks much more credible than just using your domain name.</p>
<h3>Recognition</h3>
<p>Blogs gain popularity the moment they&#8217;re recognized and remembered by an audience. This is where logos play an important role—they represent you, and make it easier for readers to connect to your blog.</p>
<h3>Authority</h3>
<p>Okay, maybe logo isn’t much of a factor to your authority. Though that doesn’t mean it should be completely set aside. In terms of authority, I think a good logo should act as an important symbol of your authority and credibility.</p>
<h2>The makings of a great blog logo</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s no concrete formula for creating a great blog logo.</p>
<p>Most of the time, it’s just the blogger&#8217;s and/or the designer’s discretion that comes into play. Being both a blogger and a designer gave me a good perspective on this issue, and based on the clients I’ve handled, these criteria have proven to be standard for every blog logo design.</p>
<h3>A color scheme that works</h3>
<p>Don’t just randomly use any color you believe is nice. Aside from the aesthetic value, remember that your logo has to be coordinated with your blog theme. Make sure you use not only the right color, but the right shade as well. Otherwise, it may seem a bit out of place or, as I said, uncoordinated.</p>
<p>There are some bloggers who do it the other way around: they start with a logo, then build their blog. I guess that makes you freer to conceptualize the logo. But of course, if     this is the case, you have to consider the theme you plan on using for the blog anyway.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’re not good at making color schemes, try <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/">Adobe Kuler</a>.</p>
<h3>Good typography</h3>
<p>Blog logos usually follow the symbol-and-text design style, since they&#8217;re also used as the header image. This is why you&#8217;ll need one good, stand-out, typographical font. Of course, the type of font that&#8217;ll be suitable will vary with your blog niche (personal blogs tend to have more artsy fonts, while professional blogs tend to go for bolder, simpler typefaces) and your personal preferences. I suggest that you steer away from complicated fonts like grunge or macabre options unless that’s really the image you want to portray.</p>
<h3>An original concept</h3>
<p>This might sound obvious, but you have no idea how often bloggers want to replicate a logo of an A-list blogger. Some of the bloggers who want to emulate a popular blog’s logo seem to think that, as a prerequisite to being great, you have to look like someone who’s already great. But really, when did someone ever achieve greatness through imitation?</p>
<h3>Good resolution</h3>
<p>Always ask for your logo to be created at high resolution. That you if you want to make it smaller, you can just resize the original logo. The trouble arises when the resolution is poor, the logo&#8217;s too small, and it gets pixelized every time you make it bigger. Not a good thing!</p>
<h3>Conveys your blog&#8217;s or your personality</h3>
<p>It’s easy to get carried away by designing for the sake of an awesome design. But never forget that your logo is not a painting: it’s there to serve a purpose, and that is to be a symbol of your blog.</p>
<h2>On creating your blog logo</h2>
<p>Okay, so now that we’re done with the reasons and essentials of logo-making, it’s now time to get into the meat of the story—making the logo itself. You have two ways to make this happen. You can either do it yourself and take full control over what happens to your logo, or hire a designer to do it for you.</p>
<p>Whichever way you choose, I have prepared a set of guidelines that’ll make the process a bit easier—or at the very least, familiar—so you’ll know what to do and what <em>not</em> to.</p>
<h3>The do-it-yourself (DIY) logo guide</h3>
<p>A cold, hard truth first: you’ll need, at the very least, basic design and editing skills to do this. In my experience, bloggers who goes this route either have no spare funds to pay for the design service, or they&#8217;re confident that they can create the logo without professional help.</p>
<p>If you have only the most basic design skills, don’t worry. Who says logos should be complicated, or loaded with effects? they don&#8217;t! Simplicity is your best asset. If you have average-to-above average design skills, lucky you! However, if you don&#8217;t have any knowledge at all in the field of design, don’t lose hope yet. There are many fool-proof design software products out there: just search for a few basic tutorials, and you’ll get the hang of it.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you&#8217;ll need to follow to design your own logo:</p>
<h4>Step 1. Get hold of a Photoshop or a similar product</h4>
<p> If you don’t have one, be resourceful and look for free online alternatives. Just Google for “free online alternatives for Photoshop” and you’ll soon find a ton of them.</p>
<h4>Step 2. Conceptualize</h4>
<p> What do you want your logo to look and feel like? If you’re stuck for ideas (like most clients I’ve met), it helps to check out competitor sites. Not that you should copy them, but this can help to get your creative juices flowing. Consider the elements of your design, the font you want to use, the colors you want to use, and even the logo&#8217;s dimensions—especially if you’ll use it as your header.</p>
<h4>Step 3. Check for originality</h4>
<p>This is the step even designers often forget. While this step is a no-brainer, it&#8217;s very important. You wouldn’t want to be accused of being a copy-cat, would you?</p>
<h4>Step 4. Execute the design</h4>
<p>This could be the hardest part, especially if you have no or little knowledge of design. Here’s a little tip though: create the logo one section at a time. Execute your symbol first, before you start thinking about the text, or vice versa. Make sure you use a good font. If you desire certain effects or elements, you can always Google for tutorials (it never fails to amaze me how people frustrate themselves with software when they could so easily just Google for a tutorial!).</p>
<p>Be sure to save the file every now and then. There’s nothing more frustrating about creating a design than losing unsaved changes, or worse: losing the whole file. Back-ups help too. Once you’re done, convert the logo to .png or .gif image files. These are the files that are best for use on the Web.</p>
<p>In creating your own design, you are obviously in full control of everything. The down-side is that your blog logo design is limited to your own designing ability (or lack thereof). Back when I ran a blogging tips blog, I never paid a cent to designers. I did everything on my own, and that’s how I acquired the skills of logo design. Who knows, you might end up on the same path too!</p>
<h3>The hire-a-designer logo guide</h3>
<p>If you don’t trust yourself with anything that has to do with art and design, I guess it’s best to leave these things in the hands of good designers. Of course, you’ll need to have some funds to take this route.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a common misconception that hiring a designer means that you need to shell out hundreds of bucks. In reality, the competition in the design industry makes the pricing competitive. In fact, you can have your own professional logo designed for under $100. So really, if you believe a great logo is a great investment (which is true), then justifying the fee isn’t really an issue.</p>
<p>If you plan on hiring a designer, or using the services of a design company, here are a few pointers that you should consider:</p>
<h4>Always check the designer&#8217;s portfolio samples</h4>
<p> Designers often use a set of styles that can be seen in action through their portfolio. It’s best if you check their previous work to ensure that you can trust them to make your logo to a standard that you&#8217;ll be happy with.</p>
<h4>Ask to see client testimonials</h4>
<p> From a designer’s perspective, I’d say trust the portfolio more than the testimonial. We all know stories on how testimonials can sometimes be manipulated, though there are of course designers that have genuinely good feedback for their excellent service. Nevertheless, it’s at least a good thing to make sure that clients speak highly of the designer. If you can, see if you can find any familiar names (or research them) to make sure that the testimonials are authentic.</p>
<h4>Read the design policy, and terms and conditions</h4>
<p> How will the designer create your design? How fast will they design it? What are the packages or offerings involved? What are the terms for revisions? Before you order, make sure that you know how the designer operates and how much the finished product will cost you (watch out for hidden fees!). If it’s a good design service then you don’t need to dig around their pages to figure out how the process will work. It should be transparent.</p>
<h4>When you order, be specific about details and/or instructions</h4>
<p> There are still a number of clients out there who provide one or two sentences of &#8220;instructions&#8221; and then expect the designer to come up with a design that’ll blow their minds. Let’s face it: designers are <em>not</em> psychics! They only do what they’re told to do (because it’s all about what the client wants) and would hesitate to venture beyond those instructions. Of course, you can always say to your designer, “I’ll let you do whatever you want,” but that’s the most frustrating instruction ever! It’s always better if you have a clear vision for your logo. It makes our job easier, it speeds up the process, and it so much lessens the need for revisions.</p>
<h4>If you can’t tell the designer what to do, at the very least tell them what <em>not</em> to do</h4>
<p> Okay, so maybe you’re really out of ideas. There’s one thing a designer will at least be grateful for—if you remind him or her of the things you don&#8217;t want to see in your logo. Then at least they’ll be aware of the major no-no’s of the design and can avoid obvious mistakes.</p>
<h4>For revisions, make up your mind, and be nitpicky</h4>
<p> It’s stressful if a client keeps on changing his or her mind about the design. First, it&#8217;s counter-productive. But you&#8217;ll also be very lucky if the design service offers unlimited revisions—if not, ongoing revisions will likely cost you extra. Be detail-specific if you ask for revisions. Trust me: your designer will want to get the job done to your satsifaction as soon as possible.</p>
<h4>Happy with your design?</h4>
<p> Thank your designer, and give them a testimonial. Not happy with your design? Perhaps you&#8217;ve chosen a design service that offer a second concept re-design, or a 100% refund policy. Again, this explains why it’s better to pick design services that are credible, reachable, and accountable.</p>
<h2>Put your logo first</h2>
<p>Whether you design it yourself or hire someone to help, a good blog logo can deliver a lot of benefits in the long run. It doesn’t really have to be expensive—all that matters is that you get to build a symbol of what your blog is all about.</p>
<p>Last but not least, remember that logos do not posses any magical abilities, so don&#8217;t expect that having one will immediately catapult you to success. You need to work hard for your logo and brand to become known, not the other way around.</p>
<p>If you have any logo-making stories, insights, of nightmares, I’d love to here about them in the comments.</p>

<li>We need to &#8220;sell&#8221; the customer on the product before they&#8217;ll click a link.</li>

<p>First up, let’s look at the email.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>One thing you’ll notice is the aspirational nature of the selling point here. This was an aspirational product, being sold to people who had an ambition. Also, the DPS audience members aren&#8217;t new to the Web—they&#8217;re comfortable with technology and this medium.</p>
<p>The other email we tested used an offer-based subject line that promoted the launch discount. While discounts certainly appeal to customers, this example shows that a discount doesn’t always have the pulling power we think it will. What works best <em>always</em> depends on your audience.</p>
<p>This email contains a number of audience-specific techniques that I’m happy to discuss in the comments if you like, but in this post, I really wanted to focus on the broader techniques that I think helped give this email—and could give any sales email—a solid head-start in the response rate stakes.</p>
<h2>1. Tie the opening to the subject line</h2>
<p>The first sentence of this email is identical to the subject line. I don’t think that’s necessarily ideal, but I do think your email has an immediate hook if your subject line identifies your key selling point, and your opening answers that point.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ll explain in a moment, this email does achieve that &#8220;answer&#8221; in its opening. But what do I mean by &#8220;answer&#8221;?</p>
<p>In this context, an answer isn&#8217;t necessarily an <em>answer</em>—to a question, for example—although it can be. An answer is a secondary piece of information that actively and substantially supports the proposition contained in your subject line. Look at a book&#8217;s chapters and you&#8217;ll see that their opening paragraphs directly relate to, explain, and/or support their titles. You&#8217;re aiming to achieve the same thing, but in a sentence.</p>
<p>So, for example, it would be much stronger to follow this email&#8217;s subject line with an aspirational opening sentence than an offer-focused opening sentence. Why? Because the selling point in this version of the email is aspiration. The opening sentence needs to reinforce that positioning whole-heartedly.</p>
<h2>2. Make the first word count</h2>
<p>The first word in this email is “wish”. It’s a present-tense verb, it directly reflects the selling point (aspiration), and it’s sweet and non-spammy. Wish? Who doesn’t have a wish?</p>
<p>I could have started with “Do you wish” or “Have you ever wished”, but those sentences just push that crucial word—<em>wish</em>—further and further away. We have micro-seconds to catch potential customers’ attention. We need to cut to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>That first word is valuable in itself from a positioning point of view, but as we&#8217;re about to see, it has much greater value than this alone.</p>
<h2>3. Link to the sales page</h2>
<p>The first link to the sales page appears on the second line of the email. It’s an <a href="../archives/2011/01/06/is-your-link-text-letting-you-down/">informational link</a> containing the name of the product.</p>
<p>The other email we tested included its first link to the sales page in the fifth paragraph, and the link text was a call to action: &#8220;Order your copy here.&#8221; In fact, that email had two links, and used the same call to action in both. As you can see, the email above <em>does not use call-to-action link text</em>.</p>
<p>I think this points to a couple of common misconceptions about writing sales copy:</p>
<ol>
<li> The first is that a call to action is the appropriate form of link text in sales copy.</li>
<li>The second is that a reader needs to be told things—that you need to &#8220;sell&#8221; them on your concept—before they’ll be sufficiently convinced to click on a link. I think most web users are more sophisticated than this. They trust their own opinions far more than yours or mine, and they know that clicking on a link is not a commitment to buy.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you look glance at the opening of this email, you see two things: “Wish you…” and a link to <em>Photo Nuts and Shots</em>. I may be alone in my take on this, but to me, that says “Problem? Solution.”</p>
<h2>4. Make it scannable</h2>
<p>You knew this was coming, right? And yes, we included a list (every point starting with a carefully chosen verb, to communicate a benefit), a bolded discount offer, and an eye-catching post-script with a competition to generate immediate action.</p>
<p>But the other email we tested had all these “scannable” elements too. So what’s the difference?</p>
<p>I think scannability has evolved from the early days of subheads-and-bullet-list advice. As we just saw, at first glance, the opening contains a problem and a solution—<em>even if the reader isn’t reading</em>. This may sound extreme, but I’ll say it: the reader doesn’t really have to move their eyes to get that information.</p>
<p>If, as we know from research, readers’ eyes stray down the left of the display, then we should provide them with as much information as we can on the far left of the page. I am an extremely lazy online reader, so I know from personal experience that this makes a big difference to comprehension.</p>
<p>I think scannability comes right down to language choice and sentence structure. On the left-hand side of this email we see—even if we don’t consciously read them—the following words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wish you could</li>
<li>Photo Nuts and Shots</li>
<li>Over 9 down-to-earth</li>
<li>For full details</li>
<li>This lush, inspiring</li>
<li>That’s 25% off</li>
<li>Of course, you’re protected</li>
<li>For more information</li>
<li>Darren Rowse</li>
</ul>
<p>This information combines to deliver:</p>
<ul>
<li>acknowledgement of a problem</li>
<li>the name of the solution</li>
<li>a link</li>
<li>value: the book length (9 chapters; I used the number because it stands out more clearly in body copy than would the word “nine”) coupled with the size of the discount (also a number)</li>
<li>reassurance</li>
</ul>
<p>The one thing to remember with this left-hand-side technique is that words in subsequent lines of the same paragraph may not display against the left-hand margin in the user’s email client. You really need to focus on first words of paragraphs with this technique.</p>
<h2>5. Beginnings and endings</h2>
<p>There’s another little scanning-related technique that I wanted to mention. Let’s look again at the list of benefits, which is probably one of the parts of any sales email that gets the most attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>harness      light to convey emotion</li>
<li>know      the rules of composition &#8230; and when to break them</li>
<li>take      the sharpest possible photo every time</li>
<li>adapt      the camera&#8217;s exposure to produce the shot you want</li>
<li>master      the concepts of shot perception, planning, and execution &#8212; in any setting</li>
<li>tap      into your unique creativity to take evocative photographs that reach out      to viewers</li>
<li>be the      best photographer you can be.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have this idea that we pay attention to the beginnings and ends of pieces of text. Take the middle sections out of these bullet points, and here’s the message you end up getting:</p>
<ul>
<li>harness      light …  emotion</li>
<li>know      the rules &#8230; break them</li>
<li>take      the sharpest … every time</li>
<li>adapt      the camera&#8217;s … shot you want</li>
<li>master      the … in any setting</li>
<li>tap      into your …. reach out to viewers</li>
<li>be the      best … you can be.</li>
</ul>
<p>This applies to other pieces of text, too. Like the first two paragraphs:</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=875938&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=93818&amp;cl=93818">Photo Nuts and Shots</a> … 25% off the cover price!</em></p>
<p><em>If you know …  100+ page ebook is for you.</em></p>
<p>And the refund paragraph:</p>
<p><em>Of course … get a full refund.</em></p>
<p>So don’t just pay attention to the left-hand side of your content. Also pay close attention to the endings of each piece of text in your email.</p>
<h2>Warning: oversell</h2>
<p>This email did achieve a good response rate. However, the complaint rate on this email was higher than the other version we tested by 0.04%.</p>
<p>That’s a small percentage, and you’d probably say it was worth it, given the higher open and click-through rates.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Darren told me that the ebook’s author, Neil Creek, also voiced concern at the strength of the message in this email. When the email was mailed to the whole of the DPS userbase, the words “every single time” were removed from the subject line.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I was extremely impressed by the product itself, and that obviously came across loud and clear in my writing. But it makes an important point about word choice and expression. The bottom line seems to be, don’t go overboard, however enthusiastic you may feel about the product.</p>
<h2>Rewriting the myths</h2>
<p>After this experiment, here&#8217;s my take on the sales email myths I outlined at the start:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use call-to-action sales links in sales emails.</strong><br />
Write your copy for the audience, and use what feels like natural link text. If it&#8217;s a call to action, fine. But it needn&#8217;t be.</li>
<li><strong>We need to &#8220;sell&#8221; the customer on the product before they&#8217;ll click a link.</strong><br />
Some readers may need convincing, but many just want to look at what you&#8217;re selling for themselves. Don&#8217;t make them hunt for the link.</li>
<li><strong>A sales email should focus on a discount or offer.</strong><br />
The focus of your email should be dictated by the audience&#8217;s needs.</li>
<li><strong>A sales email should overtly drive readers to action.</strong><br />
You don&#8217;t need to use in-your-face techniques like call-to-action link text, repetition, and screamy sales lines (&#8220;Don&#8217;t miss out! Order now! Limited stock available!&#8221;) to get results.</li>
<li><strong>Scannability is about bold font, bullet lists and subheadings.</strong><br />
Scannability is about paragraphs, sentences, and words as much as it is these presentation mechanisms.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you feel about these ideas? Do you think they&#8217;d work with your readers? What other suggestions can you add? Also, if you try some of these techniques and can share your results with us in the comments, we’d love to hear them.</p>

It is actually possible using  your own products or those of selected affiliates. And while some of you will be  thinking that word &#8220;affiliates&#8221; sounds dirty and underhanded, I&#8217;m here to tell  you that affiliate marketing is actually one of the most honest ways to make money on the Web.</p>
<p>In this post I am going to show you how you can make $10,000+ a year using your email list and a product or affiliate program. I&#8217;ll even do a bit of math to prove it.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Let me start by giving you a little overview of how this all works, in case you&#8217;re totally new to the idea. I&#8217;ll go in to more detail later on.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use your blog to grow an email list</strong><br />
If you&#8217;ve read any of <a href="http://www.problogger.net/?s=tyrant">my other guest posts</a> on Problogger you will notice that I have a pretty (un)healthy obsession with email lists. I&#8217;m constantly telling my readers to focus on growing a list of active, engaged, and interested email subscribers. It should be the main focus of almost every blog.</li>
<li><strong>Provide value</strong><br />
The most important thing to remember with this process is that you need to provide value. You need to enrich the lives of your subscribers. You need to solve their problems. Without this step you will find that your list grows largely unresponsive.</li>
<li><strong>Create a product or find affiliate programs</strong><br />
The next steps is to create a product of your own (ebook, ecourse, etc.) or find a product of someone else&#8217;s that you can promote and sell to your email list. It needs to be highly relevant, valuable, and helpful.</li>
<li><strong>Promote it to your email list</strong><br />
This stage is actually rather complex and can involve a pre-launch and launch, as well as automated messages and so on. The net result is that you make a lump sum of money during a launch period, or an ongoing stream of income from automated sales that happen over time.</li>
</ol>
<p>The whole thing can be a very exciting process and, if it&#8217;s done correctly, it is an extremely ethical way to make good money while enriching the lives of your subscriber list.</p>
<h2>Doing the math</h2>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s do a little math to see if $10,000 per year is really possible. In fact, if you really catch a hold of this concept you&#8217;ll find that $10,000 is actually rather conservative. The possibilities with this type of marketing are endless.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Capture four email subscribers per day</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s assume you are able to capture four email subscribers per day. It is a very small amount that any one can do with ideas like <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/11/23/how-a-30-minute-reject-post-brings-me-hundreds-of-subscribers-a-week/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.blogtyrant.com/how-to-blog/">this</a>.4 x 365 = 1460 subscribers per year.</li>
<li><strong>Sell a $37 ebook to 20% of your list</strong><br />
If your followers are loyal and engaged you should be able to sell to around 15% to 20% of them.1460 subscribers x 0.2 = 292 sales @ $37 = $10,804</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, for those whose lists are significantly larger than this, the estimates are conservative. For those who have smaller lists, this can serve as inspiration to keep going with your blogging work. Remember, an ebook is just one example of the multitude of things you can promote to your list.</p>
<h2>How to make $10k+ per year with email subscribers</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1213/935756569_18aac96892.jpg" border="0" alt="George is Keeping an Eye On You!" /><br />

<p>The wonderful thing about this process is that it can be expanded upon to incredible levels. For some bloggers, $10,000 is a tiny sum of money. My hope is that this post serves as a catalyst for you to learn more about the field and really take your blog to its full potential.</p>
<h3>1. Grow the email list</h3>
<p>The email list is the backbone of all good blogging income sources. If you can capture a large number of email addresses of readers who love what you write, trust your advice, and look to you for help and new information, then you are setting yourself up to be in a very profitable situation.</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;But isn&#8217;t it rude/annoying/spammy to sell stuff to my followers?&#8221; This is a very common question. I encounter so many people who don&#8217;t want to sell anything to their subscribers but, to be honest, the logic doesn&#8217;t make sense to me. Why? Because, like everyone else, you also have bills to pay, you aren&#8217;t trying to rip anyone off, and with the right products, you can help your subscribers to better their situations.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: some people abuse their lists. I don&#8217;t condone this at all. But guys like Darren, who only sell high-quality ebooks or training courses that can help you grow a bigger and better blog, are helping their subscribers. Why shouldn&#8217;t Darren make some money selling a product that has taken him years and years to acquire the knowledge to create—and helps you in a big way?</p>
<p>How can you grow your list quickly?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on value and quality information</strong><br />
Your blog needs to publish high-quality content that adds value to the lives of your readers. Every time someone sees a post on your blog, they should leave feeling like a problem is solved. This is important.</li>
<li><strong>Have an angle</strong><br />
There are hundreds of millions of blogs out there. You need an angle. Why should people read your stuff over someone else&#8217;s? Without an attached story or angle, you give a person no reason to subscribe to your blog.</li>
<li><strong>Use Aweber to add subscription boxes and send a free ebook</strong><br />
I recently wrote a post about <a href="http://www.blogtyrant.com/how-to-blog/">why I switched to Aweber</a> and the reasons are simple: you can add a subscription box to your blog in about five minutes, you can send out a series of automatic follow-up emails and, best of all, you can send out a free ebook automatically. This is a tried and tested method for capturing a lot of email subscribers: write a highly valuable ebook that <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/11/23/how-a-30-minute-reject-post-brings-me-hundreds-of-subscribers-a-week/">appeals to your niche</a>, and give it away in exchange for their subscription.</li>
<li><strong>Write guest posts related to your niche</strong><br />
Once your free ebook offering is up and running, get out there and start guest posting on as many of the top blogs as possible. Darren has a <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/02/24/9-ways-become-an-exceptional-guest-poster/">thorough post on how to do this</a>, so the only thing that I&#8217;ll add is that you should make your posts as good as possible, and in some way relate them to your free ebook. This ensures that all the visitors that trickle through to your site are interested in your stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Engage people in email, Twitter, comment threads, etc.</strong><br />
If you want your email subscribers to be loyal and engaged, you want to make sure you engage them in as many places as possible. As a general rule, I reply to every comment on my blog, and Twitter and Facebook accounts. I work from home so it&#8217;s easy for me to do this, but even if you work in an office, you should make an effort to reply to contacts and commenters each evening when you get home.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, the number of email signups you attract is a good indicator of how successful your blog is. You might be getting all the traffic in the world, but unless you can convert it somehow, you probably aren&#8217;t making much progress. Capturing as many email subscribers as possible is the first and most important step in affiliate marketing.</p>
<h3>2. Create a product and/or find an affiliate product to promote</h3>
<p>This section is broken up in to two parts—your two different options. The first option is to create your own product and sell that to your list. I prefer this option because you can tailor it to suit your readers&#8217; needs and wants. The second option is find someone else&#8217;s product to promote to your list for a commission (i.e. an affiliate program). Let&#8217;s take a look at both.</p>
<h4>Creating your own product</h4>
<p>The wonderful thing about the Internet is that it allows you to create your own product without much in the way of difficulty or start-up costs. In a recent article on <a href="http://www.blogtyrant.com/stay-home-moms-make-good-money-blogs-online-business/">how stay-at-home moms can make money</a>, I said that a product launched off the back of an expert blog is one of the easiest and most rewarding ways to make an honest living online. This is true.</p>
<p>Your product could take one of many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>an ebook</strong><br />
Creating an ebook is one of the simplest ways to make money from your blog. All you do is brainstorm a concept, write it out in Word or Open Office, tizzy it up with graphics and pictures, and then convert it into a PDF. Instant product. The problem? There are a lot of them out there. People have become a bit blind to them. If you are going to sell an ebook, you have to make sure it is of an outstanding level of quality and addresses a problem that&#8217;s massively relevant to your blogging audience. Ideally, it will cover a topic that hasn&#8217;t already been heavily written about.</li>
<li><strong>an ecourse</strong><br />
Another popular option is to develop an ecourse that teaches your readers how to do something. It could take the form of a series of emails sent out every week, or it could be an ebook mixed with video and delivered in module form. This is sometimes a better option because, the course content can be created or amended on the go, to respond to the feedback you get from users.</li>
<li><strong>a membership site</strong><br />
This is new black: it seems like everyone is creating membership sites nowadays. A membership site is basically a password-protected area of your blog that people can only access by paying. It could contain tools or courses or a forum of experts, for example. Some of the more successful membership sites are <a href="http://www.seobook.com/">SEOBook</a> and <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/pro">SEOmoz</a>.</li>
<li><strong>a physical product</strong><br />
If you are one of these talented people who have an actual real-world skill like painting or designing clothes, you might want to make your product a physical one. This can work extremely well if you have a big list of people who admire your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you decide to create, you have to make sure it appeals to your readers and continues to add value as you&#8217;ve done on your blog. People simply will not pay for something unless they know that it will add to their lives in a meaningful way.</p>
<h4>Promoting someone else&#8217;s product</h4>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have the time, energy, or ideas to create your own product, you can start out by promoting other people&#8217;s—by becoming an affiliate. For example, if I created an amazing Blog Tyrant ecourse, I would offer people the opportunity to sell that ecourse on my behalf and earn a commission (usually 40% to 80%) on every sale. If you believed in that product (trust me, it&#8217;d be awesome!) then you could sell it to your list. Money for jam.</p>
<p>There are a few prerequisites to generating an income through affiliate sales:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The product must be relevant.</strong><br />
If you run a dog-training blog there is almost no chance that my amazing Blog Tyrant product would sell to your list. You need to find affiliate products that are highly relevant to your blog.</li>
<li><strong>You must believe in it/use it yourself.</strong><br />
Personally, I never promote an affiliate product unless I use it myself. My site is all about helping people dominate their niche and grow an online business that allows them to work from home. Why would I risk my reputation (and in some cases friendships) promoting a product that I&#8217;ve never used?</li>
<li><strong>It must be reputable and safe.</strong><br />
Some affiliate programs out there really do not offer good protection for their customers. It&#8217;s getting rarer and rarer, but every now and then you come across a program that gets people involved with spam, or makes it difficult to get a refund. If you are going to promote something to your list, you want to make sure it comes from a reputable source that you know and trust. <a href="http://www.shoemoney.com/">Shoemoney</a> says that he never promotes an affiliate unless he has met the owner in person. This is a good rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please do not think that affiliate programs are all dirty. They aren&#8217;t. There are some really solid brand names out there who are promoting very valuable tools and information. Darren&#8217;s one of them. With a little bit of research and planning, you will be able to find something great for your crew.</p>
<p><em>Finding affiliate products to promote</em><br />
There are so many different places to find affiliates out there—some good, some bad. What you often find is that it is best to locate the product you want to promote first, then figure out what company that product creator is using to sign up affiliates. Some of the main ones you might want to look at include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ejunkie.com">E-junkie</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cj.com">Commission Junction</a></li>
<li><a href="http://shareasale.com">Shareasale</a></li>
<li><a href="http://clickbank.com">Clickbank.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of the larger companies run their own affiliate programs. In this case you want to visit the sites of the sellers themselves, scroll down to the very bottom and look for the Affiliates link that will direct you to the signup page.</p>
<h3>3. Sell the product to your email list</h3>
<p>The final part of this post is all about selling your product, or your chosen affiliate product, to your email list. This topic could be studied for a lifetime, but here, let&#8217;s look at a rough game-plan.</p>
<h4>Pre-launch</h4>
<p>The first step is to generate some interest among your subscribers around the product launch. You want to prepare your readers for the big sale day. There are lots of different ways to do this, and many different schools of thought as to what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Some ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a free give away</strong><br />
Having a free give away that is related to your product launch can be a good idea because people circulate the free part to their friends and on their blogs. It can also help you capture more email addresses to use for the actual promotion.</li>
<li><strong>a time-sensitive signup area</strong><br />
Something else that can work is to have a time-sensitive signup area. For example, if you are releasing a membership site you might only want to release it to 100 members. Having an earlybird signup area on the blog a week in advance can get people motivated to join, rather than risk missing out.</li>
<li><strong>create an affiliate program</strong><br />
Around this time, if you&#8217;re selling a product you&#8217;ve created yourself, you also want to set yourself up as affiliate seller so that other bloggers can sell your products. Email your list of high-profile blogging contacts, letting them know about the product launch and the affiliate program, and ask them to help you out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you decide to do, make sure it really does generate some buzz. The idea is to get as many people talking about the product, and sharing news about it, as possible.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>The launch stage is where you actually send out the email to your list promoting your new product. You should also do a post on your blog to ensure your RSS readers hear about what&#8217;s going on. Make sure your launch email:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a strong call to action</li>
<li>details all the specs of the product</li>
<li>uses social proof</li>
<li>focuses on benefits, not features.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said, this is only supposed to be a rough game-plan. There are some amazing articles out there that give you specific details on this process. I&#8217;d recommend starting with Copyblogger&#8217;s <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/landing-pages/">landing pages tutorials</a>, Darren&#8217;s video on <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/08/12/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-successful-product-launches/">product launches</a>, and Yaro&#8217;s article on <a href="http://www.entrepreneurs-journey.com/2483/how-to-create-an-e-book-and-sell-it-in-14-days-or-less/">creating an ebook</a>.</p>
<h4>Automate follow-ups for affiliate products</h4>
<p>One thing to remember is that if you&#8217;re promoting someone else&#8217;s product you don&#8217;t have to do all this launch stuff. You can actually just set it to be entirely automatic. How? Well remember we talked about Aweber&#8217;s automatic messages earlier? What you can do is create a series of follow-up emails that go to every subscriber that you get on a sequence of set days.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you subscribe to my Dog Training blog. On day one I might send you an automatic email thanking you for subscribing. Then on day three, you get an email with a highly useful dog training tip or tutorial. A week later, you get another training tip and then, maybe a day after that, I send you an email with an affiliate product that relates to the tips and tutorials, and really helps you solve the problem. It&#8217;s all automatic, and it works extremely well.</p>
<p>Remember, don&#8217;t flood your subscribers with emails, and don&#8217;t send anything out unless it&#8217;s highly valuable and useful to your subscribers. Don&#8217;t risk compromising your relationship.</p>
<h2>Have you done it? Will you try it?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;d really like to open up the comments now and ask you guys for any advice from your own email campaigns. Have you tried these kinds of approaches before? Did they work well? I&#8217;d also really like to know whether you will give this a try on your own blogs. Do leave a comment and let me know.</p>

<p>I’m new to the blogosphere, but thanks to tips from ProBlogger and a few others, I decided to make the plunge and start my own blog. It’s only been a little over a week. The day after my site went live I had nearly 2,000 pageviews and 500 unique visitors. Within the next 24 hours those numbers doubled and then I soon passed 8,000 unique visitors and 20,000 pageviews. In the week that we’ve been up, the site rose over 2.4 million spots on <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I had no experience whatsoever with blogging, social media, or technology. How did I do it?</p>
<h2>Optimizing the WTF? factor</h2>
<p>The first and most important thing I did was to research what, and how, blog posts go viral. I began by researching the concept of linkbaiting, starting with ProBlogger’s <a href="../archives/2006/09/19/an-introduction-to-linkbaiting/">classic post</a>, and then continued to study <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a>, <a href="http://popurls.com/">Popurls</a>, and other sites to get a feel for what gets spread around. One thing I learned is that titles that make people say WTF? are winners. For instance, my first viral article, <a href="http://www.topthreedaily.com/2011/01/toparticle-bible-thumping/">6 Bible Thumping Tips that Will Save Your Butt!</a>, only had a chance because the title was so intriguing. I know this because I sent out that exact same article twice, with two inferior titles, and it went nowhere. When I changed the name, it took off like a rocket.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve had several viral articles in a row, I’m confident that a quality title is everything. Here’s a trick that I use.</p>
<p>First, focus on either list posts or how-to guides. Both of those bring amazing results over and over. Second, think of something that’s traditionally considered a “negative,” combine it with a “positive,” and you’ve built instant interest. For instance, “Bible Thumping” is usually used in a derogatory way, but “saving your butt” is a good thing. You could do the same with any negative and any positive. For instance, diseases are bad and money is good. So how about an article titled, 5 Diseases I Would Pay Money To Get. Then go research and find some rare, cool disease that has positive benefits. I would click on that.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this question when considering titles: “Would this title make a person say &#8216;WTF?&#8217;”</p>
<h2>Befriending Reddit</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that I was new to social media and blogging, so I was working by trial and error. What I’ve learned pretty <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Calibri"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } --> quickly is that <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a>, and <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a> are great <em>if </em>you already have a presence on those sites. If you’ve been using them for some time and have a lot of friends and followers, then you should definitely submit your stuff. However, if you are a newbie like myself, then <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> should become your instant best friend.</p>
<p>The reason is that Facebook and Twitter are only as good as the number of friends you have. If you have no friends, then you’re submitting your work to nobody. Digg and StumbleUpon are great if you already have some time put in. I didn’t, and when I submitted my articles to those sites they were seen by absolutely nobody. If you’re new, you’re better off not submitting your stuff to them—let someone else (who is established) eventually do it for you.</p>
<p>However, Reddit is a different story. The great thing about Reddit is that when you submit an article, picture, video, or whatever, it is posted instantly for all Reddit users to see. If they like the title then they click on it, and you’re in business. The better your article/picture/video is, the more they will then share it with their friends, and so it starts to go viral.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. I posted an article called <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Calibri"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } --> called <a href="http://www.topthreedaily.com/2011/01/mindcontrol/">How Bad Boys Control Women (The Real Jedi Mind Trick)</a> on Digg and StumbleUpon, and it wasn’t looked at even once. Then I posted that same article on Reddit and it blew up. I was swarmed with visitors and it began to spread like wildfire. Reddit gives you the initial chance that all the others just don’t offer.</p>
<h2>Browsing the Web</h2>
<p>Unless you’re a creative writing machine, you probably can’t write blockbuster linkbait articles every day, so the next-best thing is to browse the web for material. I found lots of good material that was a bit older, but very well written. I <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Calibri"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } --> then <a href="../archives/2011/02/03/do-you-republish-other-people%E2%80%99s-content-you%E2%80%99ll-want-to-read-this/">got permission</a> from the author to either repost it on my site in whole or repost part of it with a link back to their site. Since the article was out of favor anyway, everyone agreed. What this did was allow me to create a new post on a cool topic, reword my title, and submit it to Reddit. This gave me a massive pageview boost, and helped the original site the article came from get a new lease on life. Everyone won.</p>
<p>Here’s the best example. I was short on creativity the other day, but I remembered hearing on the radio about the police arresting this pimp and finding his business plan. I tracked it down online, put it in a brief article I wrote, then <!-- @font-face {   font-family: "Calibri"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"; }a:link, span.MsoHyperlink { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; }a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed { color: purple; text-decoration: underline; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } --> posted <a href="http://www.topthreedaily.com/2011/02/pimps-business-plan/">A Pimp’s Actual Hand-Written Business Plan</a>. I then tossed it on Reddit and within 12 hours I had gained 15,000 new pageviews. Pimp = negative, business plan = positive. If you’re still not convinced the title strategy works, go back and take a look at the title of this article. You clicked on it. It works.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should I start an affiliate program to promote my product?&#8221; If so, &#8220;how much should I pay affiliates as a commission?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had this conversation only yesterday with one blogger who was launching his first ebook. He had decided to set up an affiliate program but was unsure about what percentage to pay. He were leaning towards 10% commissions, mainly because he didn&#8217;t want to eat into his profit margins too much. I&#8217;ll share the response I gave that blogger here.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s take a step back to look at some pros and cons of affiliate programs.</p>
<h2>Why an affiliate program could be worthwhile for your product</h2>
<p>The main reason that you should consider an affiliate program for your product is simply that it will increase the potential reach that you will have as you promote your product.</p>
<p>Whether your blog is big or small, there&#8217;s always room to increase your reach and have your offer seen by more people. Pretty much every topic has other blogs, sites, forums, and individuals interacting on social media. To set up an affiliate program increases the incentive that these sites and individuals have to promote your product.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone will be motivated by an affiliate commission (some bloggers don&#8217;t use them at all), but you will find that some are definitely moved by them and those people could open up a considerably larger audience for you.</p>
<p>Another benefit of affiliate programs is that they help to grow your own list of customers. This benefits you in the here and now with the product you&#8217;re promoting at present, but also offers potential for future products.</p>
<p>A new customer that comes in from an affiliate promotion today can turn into a life-long customer if you develop a relationship with them. A $10 sale from an ebook could end up leading to five more $10 sales in the coming year—or it could end up generating a $200 sale if you launch larger products down the track.</p>
<h2>Why you might not want to start an affiliate program</h2>
<p>I think it&#8217;s important to note that having an affiliate program isn&#8217;t always the best option for everyone. There are some costs to consider along with the opportunities they open up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decreased profit</strong>: Let&#8217;s start with the most obvious cost—affiliate programs eat into your profit margin. When someone recommends your product they do bring in new business, but you share the benefit of that business with them. A $20 ebook sale effectively becomes a $10 sale if you share a 50% commission. For some bloggers this is a stumbling block, and not something that they want to do (I&#8217;ll speak more about it below).</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: One of the big hidden costs of an affiliate program is the time that it can take to manage. I&#8217;ve not found it to be a huge time commitment, but there are some extra logistical tasks that you might find yourself doing when you introduce affiliates into your strategy. These include paying them (depending upon the system you use), providing them with sales material, motivating them, helping those who have limited technical knowledge to set up links, and so on. You will find that some affiliates need a bit more hand-holding than others—and some can be quite high maintenance!</li>
<li><strong>Loss of control</strong>: Another hidden cost of affiliate programs is that you lose a little control over the way your product is promoted. Not everyone will promote it in the same way you do. I can think of a number of times when this has been a problem—particularly when affiliates have used hype and built products up to be better than they actually are in order to get sales. In doing so they created false expectations in buyers that the owner of the product had to then manage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How much should you to pay affiliates?</h2>
<p>This is one of the most common questions I&#8217;ve been asked on this topic, but of course there are no real wrong or right answers. You&#8217;ll want to consider a number of factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Price of product</strong>: As someone who promotes a variety of products through affiliate programs, I know that it&#8217;s not just the percentage commission that I look at, but also the price of the product. For example, 50% of a $5 product is certainly not as attractive as 50% of a $100 product. There may not be a lot you can do about this, but it&#8217;ll be a factor for those considering promoting your product.</li>
<li><strong>Size of the untapped market</strong>: If you&#8217;re just starting out and don&#8217;t yet have much of an audience of your own, you might want to consider a higher commission in order to give an incentive to affiliates to work for you to get things going. However, if you have a large audience of people who trust you already, you might not be as reliant upon affiliates to help you make your product successful.</li>
<li><strong>Future product releases</strong>: Some people use affiliate programs more as lead generators than anything else. I know of a number of people who actually offer affiliates 100% of sales to give them a big incentive to promote the product. The hope is that, while the affiliate is the only person to make money from the initial promotion, the sales will generate a list of buyers to which the product owner can promote future products.</li>
<li><strong>Tiered commissions</strong>: One strategy that some product producers use is to offer bigger affiliates a higher percentage than smaller affiliates. In this way, they increase the incentive for those who have larger audiences.</li>
<li><strong>Physical vs virtual products (and other overheads)</strong>: Many information products offer affiliates 40-50% commissions. This is in part because there are limited overheads on virtual products. To sell a $20 ebook only really costs me a few cents for hosting and bandwidth, and a small amount in PayPal and shopping cart fees (after the cost of design and so on). On the other hand, a physical product will have a much smaller profit margin. I have one friend who has an online camera store, and he&#8217;s only able to offer his affiliates 4% commissions, because his own profit margin isn&#8217;t high.</li>
<li><strong>Consider your expenses carefully</strong>: Even if you&#8217;re selling virtual products, keep all of your expenses in mind. I had an interaction with an ebook seller recently who didn&#8217;t realize what the PayPal fees would be on his $5 ebooks. He offered affiliates 60% commissions on the sale price and, once he took out PayPal fees and his design and proofreading costs, he realized he wasn&#8217;t really making more than a few cents per ebook.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why I pay 40% commissions instead of 10%</h2>
<p>Let me finish with my answer to the blogger who was going to offer 10% commissions on his ebooks. He was concerned that commissions would eat into his profits, and was struggling to justify why he should really pay more to someone for simply promoting his ebook when he&#8217;d done all the work to make it.</p>
<p>I can see where he was coming from, but my philosophy for paying higher commissions on my own products (I pay 40%) is that any new customer that an affiliate brings in is a customer I&#8217;d probably never have had otherwise. So earning 60% (or $12 on a $20 ebook) is $12 more than I&#8217;d have had in my pocket than if I hadn&#8217;t had an affiliate promoting my product.</p>
<p>I also take into account the fact that that person buying my ebook might also buy future products from me (both my own and affiliate promotions that I promote). They may also recommend my products to their friends and may become a regular reader of my blog (and help to increase advertising revenue). So the inital $12 profit could end up being considerably more in time.</p>
<h2>Do you have an affiliate program for your products?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear from others who sell products from their blogs. Do you offer an affiliate program? Why, or why not? If you do, what commission level do you pay, and how did you come to that figure?</p>

<p>Isn’t the best way to impress readers by providing great content? My answer would be yes, because most people come to your site for your content.</p>
<p>There are, however, some things you can do to impress and  build credibility among your (first-time) readers even before they start to read what you have to say. How? Let me explain.</p>
<h2>Provide quantitative instead of qualitative statements</h2>
<p>People are not stupid. Messages like <em>“we are the best blog providing blogging tips”</em> won’t work. Your visitors are skeptical. They want <em>evidence</em> to show you&#8217;re the best blog for blogging tips. That’s why it’s important to provide quantitative instead of qualitative statements. Here are some examples of quantitative statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>116 new subscribers daily</li>
<li>over 56 new twitter followers every day</li>
<li>join over 170, 000 subscribers (this example&#8217;s from ProBlogger!).</li>
</ul>
<p>In conversion rate optimization, using statements such as these is considered a best practice. Why? Because it consistently produces higher conversion rates.</p>
<p>There is, however, one good way to provide believable <em>qualitative</em> statements&#8230;</p>
<h2>Let somebody else do the bragging for you</h2>
<p>This concept is used a lot around products releases, where it&#8217;s known as &#8220;providing testimonials.” But, of course, you can use the same concept  for your own website? If, for example, Darren mentioned something nice about your  blog, why not showcase it to your readers? An example might be:</p>
<p><em>“Absolutely the most useful blog on WordPress Tips”—Darren Rowse, ProBlogger.com</em></p>
<p>As you can notice, this is a qualitative statement (without any specific evidence). People won’t believe you if you brag about yourself. “We’re the best, the greatest, the cheapest&#8230;” Sorry, that doesn’t work. Do you believe it when the author of a  specific blog says they&#8217;re the best in their niche? One of the  first questions that comes to mind after reading this is, “<strong>Why</strong> are you the cheapest, greatest, and best?”</p>
<p>There is some research, however, to support the claim that if you let  another person do “the bragging” for you, then you can establish credibility quickly.  In chapter 22 of his best-selling book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yes-Scientifically-Proven-Ways-Persuasive/dp/1416570969">50 Scientifically Proven Ways  to Be Persuasive</a></em>, Dr. Robert Cialdini mentions a study he’s done with  Jeffrey Pfeeffer (you can <a href="http://www.jeffreypfeffer.com/pdf/articles/PSPB-Oct2006.pdf">view the study here</a> in PDF format). </p>
<p>The pair asked study participants to imagine themselves  in the role of a chief editor for a particular book  publisher. Their current job was dealing with a particular author. To get an  impression of that author, they had to read an excerpts of a negotiation  for a sizable book advance. The results showed that the participants  rated the author more favorably in every area when his bragging was  done by his manager, than in those areas where the author bragged about himself.</p>
<p>If you mention a quote from someone else (like in the above ProBlogger example), then it’s best to put it above the fold—next to your logo, for example. There&#8217;s often a lot of empty space there, and some people use that for  ads, but you can use it for building credibility among first-time  visitors.</p>
<h2>Put a universal Like button on your blog</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig1subscribe.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13661" title="fig1subscribe" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig1subscribe.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="97" /></a></p>
<p>The above screen shot is from <a href="http://Mashable.com">Mashable.com</a>. At the top of their sidebar, they display a universal Like button which is visible on every post and every page.</p>
<p>This can communicte significant social proof, and has one big advantage: it’s very easy to click on. Also, it’s very easy to locate—more on that later.</p>
<p>Why use this instead of the Facebook social plugin? After all, Problogger does:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig2pro-sub1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13662" title="fig2pro-sub1" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig2pro-sub1.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="218" /></a></p>
<p>The answer is that the Facebook social plugin has several disadvantages :</p>
<ul>
<li>It has to be placed below the fold and in the sidebar. Space above the fold is most commonly used for ads.</li>
<li>The Facebook Like button is a lot harder to find, with so many elements competing for users&#8217; attention. I  would estimate that the single Like option on the universal button is at least three times easier to  find because there’s a number next to it, and eyetracking studies tell us that people’s attention  focuses on numbers (mostly because they are an indicator of facts, and people love to read facts online).</li>
<li>Why would I like to &#8220;Find the Blog on Facebook&#8221; if I’m already on the blog? That instruction simply doesn’t make sense. It’s not one of the things I want to do. The thing I want to do while on a blog is read its content, and if it’s good, I can either like it or not. As such, a simple Like button is more relevant to users&#8217; intentions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The universal Like button creates credibility very quickly. Everyone’s on Facebook. By seeing your Like button—and the number of people who like your blog—visitors will understand that there are real people reading your blog. This further establishes social proof: the bigger the number of people who Like your blog, the better.</p>
<h2>When to apply these principles &#8230; and when to ignore them</h2>
<p>Are these principles applicable to all blogs? No. It  all depends on what you blog is about, and who&#8217;s in your audience. For example, I blog about people search, and I can’t really apply these principles to great effect, because I can’t built a loyal audience. My audience members&#8217; goals are pretty short-term: they are looking for a person&#8217;s details, and once they find that information, they’re gone.</p>
<p>But I would recommend these principles to owners of blogs that have a potential to build long-term audience relationships, like people trying to build a more successful blog, people trying to make money online, people  trying to save money, and so on. I would recommend these principles for people trying to build a loyal audience—and I’m pretty most of you are doing that.</p>
<p>What other techniques have you used to impress visitors to your blog as soon as they arrive? I&#8217;d love to hear about them in the comments!</p>

<p>I write for two blogs that are both travel-themed, yet very different from one another.  <a href="http://www.brookevstheworld.com">Brooke vs. the World</a> has been my personal travel blog for the past four years, while <a href="http://www.australiablog.com">WhyGo Australia</a> is more of a travel guide blog which is part of a larger travel network, and focuses on making money. Because of their different natures, I approach the way I write and promote each of these blogs in a different manner.</p>
<p>Brooke vs. the World has been around for a while now, and since I have a bit of clout in the online travel community, it does draw the attention of advertisers and has various avenues of making money.  Lately, though, I&#8217;ve been trying to come to terms with whether or not I want to take it a step further to a point of it becoming a real money-maker. In considering my options, I&#8217;ve realized that this process would involve overcoming several challenges.</p>
<h2>Prioritizing commercial topics over personal topics</h2>
<p>Most personal bloggers choose to write about topics that only pertain to them, and do it in a way that requires them to talk about themselves. This approach can help build a following of people that truly can relate to you and what you&#8217;re doing, but it&#8217;s likely that focusing more heavily on broader topics that a more general audience can relate to from time to time will mean you can monetize your blog more successfully. There&#8217;s also the need to choose topics that fare better for SEO and purposely cause discussion.  In other words, if you monetize your personal blog, you might have to blog about topics that aren&#8217;t as near and dear to your heart all the time.</p>
<p>For example, on my personal blog, I&#8217;d find it a bit bland to write an article on the “5 Best Budget Hostels in Antigua, Guatemala.&#8221;  I&#8217;d much prefer to talk about my experiences with meeting new people there, perhaps in an article called, “The Amazing Friends I Met in Hostels in Guatemala.&#8221;  Obviously, the first topic is going to appeal to a larger audience, maybe perform better with the search engines, and produce a better way of introducing affiliate programs with direct calls to action (think: “book your stay now&#8221;).</p>
<h2>Censoring personal feelings</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you might use a personal blog as a way to vent and share your personal feelings.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that—in fact, it can be a good way to connect with readers.  However, if you monetize your blog, times may arise when it is best to not show your deep-down honest feelings—perhaps when you really dislike something.  That&#8217;s a factor that can change in a blog when it starts to become a business: being openly judgmental can drive some potential advertisers away.</p>
<p>I let my personal feelings about traveling in New Zealand slip out on my blog last year.  Sure, there were plenty of reasons why my feelings on the subject were negative, but by not censoring myself, I may have killed any chances of landing a media-related trip to New Zealand, or of working with New Zealand-themed advertisers in the future.</p>
<h2>Broadening the horizons</h2>
<p>Along with prioritizing commercial topics, the personal blogger looking to monetize their blog may need to broaden their scope. Talking about travel experiences and telling travel tales is one thing, but to gain a larger audience, you may try to provide experiences and tales for more than the countries that you&#8217;ve visited yourself.  In addition, tackling list-style posts and easy-reading type articles can be a great way to draw in different types of readers. But are they your thing?</p>
<p>I think Darren touches on this point by talking about how his video posts do better when he has both the video and the transcription together.  There are simply different kinds of audiences:  some are visual (preferring photos or videos); others like to read about it.  Some visitors are looking for a personal tale from a travel blog, while others want to know how exactly they can do the same things you did in a step-by-step guide.  Each of these visitor types means that you may gain by branching out from your normal style.  But personally, I find list posts and how-to guides feel less personal and unique (the majority of the time), and video blogs time-consuming.</p>
<h2>Opening it up to others</h2>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not necessarily essential, opening up a blog to focus more on others (another step in broadening the horizons) is beneficial when it comes to gaining more interest from your audience.  You can achieve this by writing interviews, accepting guest posts, and linking more frequently to outside resources.  Any way it happens, it will draw more attention to your blog. Yet it is a task that can be difficult to do smoothly if, so far, you&#8217;ve been focusing  solely on your own story. </p>
<p>Brooke vs. the World, for example, has been a blog about my personal journey; the title pretty much says so.  The objective has always been to share my travels, so the thought of adding another voice to the mix through guest posts would seem to break the continuity of what has now been years in the making.</p>
<h2>Getting over the fear of selling</h2>
<p>If a blog doesn&#8217;t start out to make money, it can feel as though the blogger is <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/10/25/5-ways-to-monetize-your-blog-without-selling-out/">selling out</a> by changing their focus to monetization later on.  I think this is my number one issue with taking my personal blog to the next level—the fear that what I do and say will be only taken at face value, instead of genuinely.  So, while I may feel strongly about the benefits of a certain product I&#8217;m writing about, I often fear making the initial call to action to achieve the response I&#8217;m looking for.</p>
<p>The fact that I struggle with this aspect could be all in my head, or it could be because the selling tone just doesn&#8217;t fit in with my personal blog&#8217;s voice.  I&#8217;ve tried several times to write articles that are focused on the sale, but it just sounds out of place and inauthentic.  I often worry that people will think that I&#8217;m only saying that I like a specific tour or travel product because I&#8217;m hoping to make some quick money from the sales.</p>
<h2>Getting over the fear of selling yourself</h2>
<p>Self-promotion is essential for making yourself stand out in a crowded niche such as travel, yet for many people, it&#8217;s not easy to do.  You have to be able to tell people why you are interesting to follow and, most importantly, how they can gain from it themselves.  Otherwise, you&#8217;ll be just another fish in the big Internet sea, swimming around waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>Part of the process of drawing attention to yourself, however, can feel like bragging.  Since most personal blogs have just a person behind them, there&#8217;s no business name to hide behind. So selling yourself seems very much like talking yourself up to others, which is what we were raised to think is impolite and annoying. I&#8217;m sure there is a fine line here, but I often find myself questioning whether it&#8217;s worth the risk of crossing that line.</p>
<p>I generally have no issues doing any of these activities with WhyGo Australia, since it&#8217;s a part of my job and I&#8217;m backed by a really awesome independent travel company. Overcoming these challenges with my personal blog is another story—and one that I continue to struggle with.</p>
<p>Have any of you felt the same when it comes to trying to make the change from personal blog to money-maker?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get it straight. Blogging is not a standalone job. You cannot blog in a space that doesn&#8217;t exist and to a group of virtual people. You need people—yes, living human beings, not just pairs of eyeballs—to read your<br />
blog.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t just need people to read what you write; you need people to:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree/disagree with you</li>
<li>give you different perspectives/thoughts/suggestions</li>
<li>follow as role models/examples</li>
<li>endorse/recommend you to the public</li>
<li>share things with</li>
<li>buy your stuff and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you <em>need</em> people in the blogosphere. Period.</p>
<p>Blogging has evolved so far, so strongly, and in an awesome way because of relationships. Just imagine the number of people who hunt blogs for information these days. A <em>big</em> number is just on and around blogs. So you need to make good use of that number.</p>
<p>Let me give you three tips (surely the not-so-trivial kind) to get along with people in the blogging world.</p>
<h2>1. Comment</h2>
<p>Commenting—not spamming, but giving out your genuine thoughts and views about a particular blog post—will help you to develop an excellent relationship with the author of the article. Everyone knows this. So how can you comment to build relationships (apart from links) effectively?</p>
<p>Reach out to growing bloggers and to those bloggers who are in the same stage as you in their blogging journey. Every comment you make on your favorite A-lister&#8217;s blog will indeed help you make friends, attract new visitors, and sometimes even attract subscribers. This is conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to make a habit of commenting in the not-so-big, yet growing blogs (apart from the A-list blogs that are your favorites and those you comment for link-building purposes). Spend some time to find out a handful of blogs in your niche that are just growing, and comment in them in a consistent and useful way.</p>
<p>Your first friend will be the blogger, of course. And he or she will return the favor. You become <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/09/13/1-easy-solution-to-3-big-blogging-problems/">blogging buddies</a> and comment on each others&#8217; posts regularly.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you can do after that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate personally with the blogger. Give suggestions, ask for advice, help each other, and so on.</li>
<li> Trade off Tweets and Facebook shares. This works great for me. I share their posts, and the favor is returned. So if you have ten blog buddies like this, the exposure you&#8217;ll get can be fairly decent. I have also gained new subscribers and friends who are friends of those buddy bloggers.</li>
<li>Endorse each other&#8217;s products/services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Guest post</h2>
<p>Guest posting is great for link building and for traffic—quite true. But how about guest posting for developing strong relationships?</p>
<p>Among various other benefits of guest posting, developing relationships with others is one of the main benefits. How can you achieve that? Again, aim not only for the A-list, but go for the growing blogs. This time you need to filter a bit more. Find out blogs that are doing great with readers and comments, and simply forget about the PR for this moment (I say this because I personally know and follow many blogs that have excellent content, and a great number of loyal readers and fans, but the blog&#8217;s page rank is 0).</p>
<p>Write a very useful post (you know that!) and close it by opening the topic up for a discussion. Given that the blog has decent number of readers who comment, a call to action should work great. Now it&#8217;s your turn to build relationships. Make it a point to respond to <em>every</em> comment in your guest post. But go further. Encourage discussions in the comments. And give out additional tips and secrets in replies to the commenters.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for CommentLuv-enabled blogs. They normally have good number of people who comment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/commentluv.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-13696" title="commentluv" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/commentluv.png" alt="" /></a>CommentLuv is a cute little WordPress plugin that fetches the recent  post of the commenter (from the website feed) as he/she types the comment, and displays it after the comment. If a blog has the CommentLuv plugin enabled, there should be a little checkbox below the comment Submit button, as shown here.</p>
<p>Checking the box will display the recent post. If you have registered your blog at <a href="http://comluv.com/">the ComLuv website</a>, you can choose to display any one of the ten most recent posts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/comluv-registered.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13697" title="comluv-registered" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/comluv-registered.png" alt="" width="616" height="410" /></a></p>
<p>That &#8216;s not all. You also have a search option at ComLuv website. You can  search for CommentLuv-enabled blogs in your niche by entering  appropriate keywords.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/commentluv/">Download CommentLuv plugin here</a>, and register your blog at <a href="http://comluv.com/" target="_blank">comluv.com</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Linking</h2>
<p>Write round-up posts on your blog that link to other posts. Do this periodically: once in a week or two, write a round-up post. This time, you need to aim only for the big players: A-list blogs. Your post can be centered around one post from a particular A-list blog, or a collection of posts from different blogs with either the same or different topics.</p>
<p>You can follow any or all of the following strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write one blog post agreeing/disagreeing/appreciating/casting your extra views on one popular blog<br />
post. <strong>Caution:</strong> Don&#8217;t be tempted to get dirty and disagree with popular bloggers just to gain attention.</li>
<li>Write one blog post on a topic and quote four or five related blog posts to validate your thoughts.</li>
<li>Pick four or five popular blog posts of A-list bloggers, not necessarily in a very narrow topic, and write a list post that ties them all together.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have got to try it and see. You will get a lot of exposure, friends—and loyal readers.</p>
<p>The bottom line? You cannot blog alone. You need the support of nice people to blog successfully. Don&#8217;t just be obsessed with SEO and link building; rather, seek to develop true and long-lasting relationships.</p>
<p>Just ask this to yourself: &#8220;Why do I blog?&#8221; There can be many answers, but this will be surely one of your answers: &#8220;to create relationships with others.&#8221; Unless you&#8217;re writing a blog that&#8217;s entirely private, you blog for relationships. You write for people—your friends, your students, your clients, your community, your gender,  or people with particular interest or issues. So make the most of those relationships.</p>
<p>What methods do you adopt to develop blogging relationships? And what works best for you?</p>

<p>Every time you write a post, you determine the angle you’ll take—even if you’re not consciously doing so. Just as taking a photograph from a different angle can yield very different results (imagine a photo taken from the base of a large tree, a photo taken from the top of the same tree, and a close-up shot of an individual leaf), covering a story from a different angle can give your readers a brand-new experience, even if you’ve covered a topic before.</p>
<p>As always, Regator has calculated the ten most-blogged-about stories of the last month, and we’ll be using posts about those popular stories to demonstrate the power of choosing the right angle. (The blogosphere trends for the month of January 2011, in order, were: <a href="http://regator.com/whatshot/Egypt/">Egypt</a>, <a href="http://regator.com/whatshot/state+of+the+union/">State of the Union</a>, <a href="http://regator.com/whatshot/Golden+Globes/">Golden Globes</a>, <a href="http://regator.com/whatshot/Verizon+iPhone/">Verizon iPhone</a>, <a href="http://regator.com/whatshot/Gabrielle+Giffords/">Gabrielle Giffords</a>, <a href="http://regator.com/whatshot/Super+Bowl/">Super Bowl</a>, <a href="http://regator.com/whatshot/Martin+Luther+King+Jr/">Martin Luther King Jr</a>, <a href="http://regator.com/whatshot/Sundance+Film+Festival/">Sundance Film Festival</a>, <a href="http://regator.com/whatshot/flooding+queensland/">Flooding</a>, and <a href="http://regator.com/whatshot/consumer+electronics+show/">Consumer Electronics Show</a>.) Here are some tips on finding the right angle for your next post, along with examples showing how a few bloggers used unexpected angles to put a new spin on these oft-covered topics… <em>and</em>, more importantly, how you can use similar ways of thinking to turn a trickle of post ideas into a flood.</p>
<h2>1. Narrow down a broad story by choosing one element</h2>
<p>The top story for the month is, of course, Egypt. While it is valuable for us to hear the general details, it’s not valuable for every blogger to provide the same information. To find an angle that would provide unique content to its readers, <em>Threat Level</em> first narrowed the story down to one aspect: the shutting down of Egypt’s Internet access. Still, plenty of bloggers were writing about that, so they went even further by focusing on just one aspect of the shutdown: how it was actually achieved by those in power. </p>
<p>Because of this very specific angle, the resulting post, <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/egypt-isp-shutdown/">Egypt Shut Down Its Series of Tubes With a Series of Phone Calls</a>, is interesting and stands out amidst the crowd. A story doesn’t need to be as massive as the Egyptian revolution for this tactic to work. Try taking the subject of your next post and narrowing it down. Then, if you can, take <em>that</em> and narrow it down again.</p>
<h2>2. Find the right angle for your niche</h2>
<p>A story like President Obama’s State of the Union address may seem like a political story—and it is—but it’s not limited political bloggers. <em>Smart Politics</em> is a political blog but the angle it chose to cover this story would work just as well for a linguistics or psychology blog. The post, <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2011/01/obamas_sotu_uniting_the_countr.php">Obama&#8217;s SOTU: Uniting the Country&#8230;through Pronouns?</a>, is a fascinating examination of the President’s use of pronouns as a unifying device.</p>
<p>The next time you think, “That’s a really interesting story but it doesn’t fit into my blog,” ask yourself if there’s any element to the story or angle you could take that might make it a great fit for readers in your niche. You might be surprised.</p>
<h2>3. Look for trends</h2>
<p>Analyzing a story for patterns or trends is another way to find an angle. There was no doubt that celebrity fashion blog, <em>Go Fug Yourself</em>, was going to cover the Golden Globes from a fashion perspective, but by finding a red-carpet trend, its post, <a href="http://gofugyourself.com/golden-globes-trend-carpet-bestworst-green-01-2011">Golden Globes Trend Carpet: Best/Worst Green</a>, not only gave readers the gossip on the awards ceremony but also advised its fashion-conscious readership of an upcoming trend.</p>
<p>See if you can find a legitimate pattern or trend in a story you’re covering. Identifying trends before the rest of the blogosphere will help your blog become <em>the </em>place to go for those who want to be in-the-know.</p>
<h2>4. Try a personal or emotional angle</h2>
<p>It’s no accident that every news organization features “human interest” along with its hard news. Stories involving emotions and struggles of everyday people are almost universally appealing. When writing about the launch of the Verizon iPhone, <em>The Next Web</em>’s <a href="http://thenextweb.com/2011/02/04/verizon-throws-best-customers-under-the-bus-charges-them-3x-for-iphone/">Verizon Throws Best Customers Under the Bus: Charges Them 3X for iPhone</a> post focuses on the anger of a long-time Verizon customer. Try finding an emotional or personal angle in a post you’re working on.</p>
<h2>5. Focus on an interesting but seldom-covered aspect of the story</h2>
<p>Every story is made up of thousands of details. <em>Slate: Press Box</em>’s <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2280806/?from=rss">Jared Loughner is ready for his photo op</a> post analyzed a rarely talked about aspect of the man accused of shooting Representative Gabrielle Giffords and several others: his mugshot and, more specifically, his baldness and the cultural implications of a shaved head. The uniqueness of this angle made the post a captivating read.</p>
<p>Make a list of at least ten different aspects of a story that you’re covering, then try to choose an unusual angle to create a distinct post that your readers won’t find elsewhere.</p>
<h2>6. Turn one story into three (or more) posts</h2>
<p> There are countless ways to tell every story. <em>The Business Insider</em>’s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-bet-on-the-super-bowl-online-2011-2">How To Bet On The Super Bowl – A Click-By-Click Guide</a> chose to focus on betting. Other blogs talked about uniform choice, psychological preparation of the players, Super Bowl party snacks, and many, many other facets of the game.</p>
<p>If a story is relevant to your readership, you need not limit yourself to just one post about it. If you can find several angles that each provide something unique and interesting, you can get several quality posts out of just one story.</p>
<h2>7. Take an unexpected approach</h2>
<p>In general, the more unexpected your angle, the more likely it is to be shared. I saw <em>i09</em>’s <a href="http://io9.com/5735912/martin-luther-king-in-science-fiction">Martin Luther King In Science Fiction</a> passed around Facebook and Twitter more than any other individual post about Martin Luther King Jr Day. Now that may be because I’m friends with too many nerds, but I think it’s actually because the angle was so unexpected. I’m not a big science fiction fan, but even I clicked on the link to see what the connection between King and sci fi was.</p>
<p>I think it’s important to surprise your readers now and then to keep them engaged. The unexpected makes an impression.</p>
<h2>8. Research the historical angle or backstory of an event</h2>
<p><em>The Daily Beast</em> looked back at the Sundance Film Festival and found that many of this year’s Oscar nominees had started at the festival. The combination of finding a trend and researching historical data yielded the post <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-01-28/christopher-nolan-darren-aronofsky-more-oscar-sundance-filmmakers/">Filmmakers Who Started At Sundance</a>.</p>
<p>There are myriad stories hiding in history. A bit of research might reveal an angle you never considered.</p>
<h2>9. Remember that there are always more stories than you think</h2>
<p>When parts of Queensland, Australia, were affected by severe flooding, <em>Fran Jurga’s Hoof Blog</em> combined several of the techniques we’ve talked about above in the post <a href="http://hoofcare.blogspot.com/2011/01/university-of-queenslands-equine.html">University of Queensland&#8217;s Equine Hospital Keeps Its Head Up Above the Flood</a>. This intriguing post took a broad story and found a way to apply it to the blog’s niche; it struck emotional chord with details of horses who’d worn their hooves down by swimming up to 30 hours to stay alive; it narrowed the story down first to horses affected by the flood, then to horses being cared for by a single veterinary hospital; and it took an unexpected and seldom-taken approach to flood coverage.</p>
<h2>10. Write a story from someone else’s perspective</h2>
<p>This is one of the easiest ways to find an alternative angle, but it&#8217;s also one of the most effective. While most blogs were covering the <strong>Consumer Electronics Show</strong> from the perspective of attendees or companies presenting new products, <em>Gadget Lab</em> chose to post <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/01/behind-ces/">It Takes a Mountain of Shipping Crates to Make a Trade Show</a> from the perspective of the organizers, providing a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the massive conference.</p>
<p>Consider covering a story from another party’s perspective to provide a whole new story.</p>

<p>Many people want to write a book and maybe you’re one of them. Perhaps you don’t want to write a novel, but these fiction writing techniques can still help you improve your blog.</p>
<h2>1. Character </h2>
<p>At its core, fiction is about characters and how they live, who they are and what they go through in the course of a book. If a reader doesn’t care about the character, why should they bother reading on? The same is true of your blog. If readers don’t care about you as the main character, they will go elsewhere. If your content is dry and devoid of personality, people will click away.</p>
<p>You can show character through the use of personal anecdotes about you and your life, either on your blog or through social networks. You can use video or audio to present a more rounded view and incorporate the rich variety of your life to infuse blog with character.</p>
<h2>2. Setting</h2>
<p>All books have a setting, and so do blogs. In fiction, it might be a faraway planet, ancient Rome or a vampire’s lair that give a sense of place. For blogging, the equivalent is your blog design including use of images, color and theme. This will set the tone for your blog or your book and is just as important for either. </p>
<p>A blog on finding true love is unlikely to have a dark, Gothic theme; a sports blog will probably not be pink and fluffy. Setting and blog design influence how the content is perceived before people even start reading so it’s critical to consider what people experience when they first arrive at your site.</p>
<h2>3. Genre</h2>
<p>It’s important when writing fiction to consider the genre you are writing in, because the rules and expectations differ widely. Consider romance, science-fiction, and horror. The readers are different. The books sit in different places on bookshelves. It’s the same with blogging. You can try to span multiple areas but you will find your message diluted. Decide on your genre or niche and stick with it. It’s the only way to make an impact.</p>
<h2>4. Plot</h2>
<p>The plot of a novel is the story that pulls a reader through the book to the climactic finish and leaves them wanting more. </p>
<p>On a small scale, every blog post needs to act this way. You want people to read to the end so try to pull them through with a story or save your best information to the climax. On a larger scale, your blog needs to have a plot that keeps people coming back over time. That can be a posting schedule based on delivering specific information on different days of the week. It can be categories of posts that spark areas of interest, or a series of blog posts that tie a whole subject together. It might also be sharing compelling aspects of your life that function as a plot over time.</p>
<h2>5. Dialogue</h2>
<p>Dialogue between characters is critical in bringing a novel to life. It allows us to glimpse the people behind the story and watch interactions between the characters. As a writer, dialogue can sometimes be surprising when your characters behave differently than you expected. You can also give a problem to characters to explore in dialogue and often find your writing issues solved.</p>
<p>Comments on your blog and interactions on your social networks are the dialog between you and your reader. You can use this dialog to glimpse your readers behind the text of your blog and use the information to adjust your content accordingly. You may be surprised at who your readers actually are.</p>
<h2>6. Show, don’t tell</h2>
<p>This is the cardinal rule of fiction writing. The point is to always demonstrate a character through action or dialogue, rather than exposition. So instead of saying “Jane was kind to animals”, you show Jane rescuing a wild bird from barbed wire, speaking in a calm voice while carefully separating the torn feathers.</p>
<p>In blogging these days, you can use multi-media to show, not tell. For example, if you’re doing a post on how to perform a perfect golf swing, make a video that shows the exact steps instead of writing a text post. That will bring your site to life as well as providing valuable information for your audience. You can also create audio interviews and information on topics that demonstrate your expertise and enable your audience to know, like and trust you.</p>
<p>So embrace your fiction writing skills and improve your blog at the same time! How are your fiction writing skills coming along? Do you use these techniques on your blog?</p>

<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve developed a troubleshooting methodology while working with my WordPress technical support clients.  My methodology helps  to solve the majority of WordPress crashed sites I&#8217;ve come across, and I wanted to share it with you, the good readers of ProBlogger.</p>
<p>I cannot claim that I invented the process, but I have brought together a number of useful tips from the WP community and combined them to create a repeatable and verifiable way to isolate and troubleshoot WordPress problems.</p>
<h2>The process</h2>
<p>This methodology isolates the various layers of a WordPress site one at a time, tests a layer by removing its component parts, and then, if the problem still exists, moves down to test the next layer.</p>
<p>Once you have isolated the problematic component, you can remove it from your site and troubleshoot the problem itself.</p>
<p>I recommend doing this in a slow and ordered manner, incrementally testing each layer as you go. Look at a layer, disable all of the components, and slowly restart them to find out where the problem lies.</p>
<h2>The layers</h2>
<p>I like to divide WordPress into four layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>plugins</li>
<li>theme</li>
<li>WordPress core</li>
<li>database.</li>
</ul>
<p>This methodology looks at the first three layers only.</p>
<h2>What can this process fix?</h2>
<p>This methodology can be used to fix a variety of WordPress issues including, bit not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the dreaded “white screen of death” where all you can see is a white screen and nothing else</li>
<li>&#8220;Header Already Sent&#8221; errors</li>
<li>&#8220;Fatal Plugin&#8221; errors</li>
<li>&#8220;Out of Memory&#8221; errors</li>
<li>…many other WordPress problems, too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Back up first</h2>
<p>Even if your site has crashed, it&#8217;s important to stop, take a moment, and back up your site as it is now.  You are about to embark on a journey which will make a lot of changes to your site.  Taking a backup of the site as it stands means you can fall back to your starting position if you need to, without making the situation any worse.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting plugins</h2>
<p>I always start at the plugin layer when I&#8217;m troubleshooting a WordPress problem. In my experience, about 80-90% of system crashes are caused by plugin issues. This is because there are so many plugins (sometimes of questionable coding quality) available to WordPress site owners.  Combining these plugins with other plugins, themes, and WordPress itself creates an untested mix that can very easily crash your site.</p>
<p>This is how I troubleshoot plugins:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable all plugins.</li>
<li>Has the problem gone? If it has, you have an issue at the plugin layer, if not, move down to next layer the theme.</li>
<li>Re-activate plugins one at a time.</li>
<li>Test your site after each reactivation. Has the problem returned? If so, you have now found the suspect plugin: go to point 5. If not, rinse and repeat from point 3.</li>
<li>Disable that plugin.</li>
<li>Re-activate the other plugins to ensure you don’t have multiple plugin problems.</li>
<li>If the problem is still cleared, you have isolated and remove the problem. Go to the Getting Support section below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes plugins cause such a problem that when you try to log into the dashboard to disable them, all you get is the same error message. If you cannot log into the dashboard, all is not lost: I have a work-around for you.</p>
<p>What you need to do is connect to your site via FTP and navigate to the <code>wp-content</code> folder.  If you rename the <code>plugins</code> directory, to <code>plugins_temp</code> for example, WordPress no longer knows where the plugin files are, and stops running them.  Now if you try to log in to the site, you&#8217;ll find that the issue has probably gone.</p>
<p>If you then proceed to the Plugins section in your Dashboard, you will see an error message that the plugin files cannot be found and have been disabled. Rename <code>plugins_temp</code> and you plugin files will be available again. Now, incrementally start from point 2 above to see which one caused the problem.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting themes</h2>
<p>Once you have tested the plugins to rule them out, you need to move down a layer to the theme. This is how I troubleshoot themes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable the current theme.</li>
<li>Activate a default theme such as Twenty ten.</li>
<li>Test. If the problem has gone, you know the theme is causing issues. If not, move down to the WordPress core layer.</li>
<li>Re-activate all of the plugins individually to make sure there is not a composite problem. If the problem doesn&#8217;t recur, you&#8217;ve isolated the theme as the problem area.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, I&#8217;d try to rule out any changes I&#8217;d made to the theme by removing any code I had recently added. If I have updated the theme, I&#8217;d roll back to a previous version. If I have just added a new widget, I&#8217;d try to back this out.  As you can see, the process is all about back-tracking methodically so you can repair the issue.</p>
<p>Again, if you cannot log into the dashboard there is a work-around. Connect to your site via FTP, and navigate to the <code>wp-content/themes</code> directory. If you now rename your currently live theme directory to <code>themdir_temp</code> for example, WordPress won&#8217;t know where the theme files are. All you&#8217;ll see at the front end is a white screen, but the dashboard will be available. Go to point 2 above and activate a default theme.  Remember to change the name of <code>themedir_temp</code> back to <code>themedir</code> to help troubleshooting.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting WordPress Core Files</h2>
<p>The last layer to check are your WordPress core files.  This is the last layer because it is the least problematic, but I have seen incidents where files have become corrupt, stopping WordPress from working correctly.  The easiest way to troubleshoot WordPress core files is to re-install a clean copy.</p>
<p>This is my process for troubleshooting WordPress core files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download a clean version of WordPress from <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">http://wordpress.org/download/</a>.</li>
<li>Connect to your site via FTP.</li>
<li>Rename <code>wp-admin</code> and <code>wp-includes</code> to ensure you are uploading clean copies of these directories.</li>
<li>Back up <code>wp-config.php</code> just in case. This files holds your database connection details (amongst other things).</li>
<li>Upload your clean version of WordPress.</li>
<li>Test. Is your issue fixed? If so, you have isolated the problem at WordPress core. If not, it’s time to call in the experts.</li>
<li>Re-activate your theme and test it.</li>
<li>Re-activate your plugins and test them.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Fixing the component</h2>
<p>At this point, you have hopefully isolated the component of your site that was causing issues.  So what do you do now?  Here are your options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the plugin or theme developers&#8217; site and check to see if they have a support forum to search or request support from. Any developer worth his or her salt will be only too happy to provide support, and premium plugins and themes should provide top-class support as part of your fee. Remember to be nice to them if it’s a free theme or plugin and they don’t reply in five minutes.</li>
<li>Find a replacement for the plugin or theme. There is usually more than one implementation of a plugin, so if you can, swap out the problematic plugin with another one.</li>
<li>Request some support from <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">http://wordpress.org/support/</a>. This is excellent for core WordPress problems, and you will often find forums for individual plugins there, too.</li>
<li>Set the social media monster to work on your problem. Sometimes it’s as easy as sending out a tweet to your network to find a solution to the problem.</li>
<li>Get the pros in—hire a WordPress technical support team or consultant to solve your problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>I use this methodology on a daily basis—it’s proven in the field on crashed sites.  The key is to methodically work through the layers, eliminating as you go, until you find the root cause. Then, fix that issue.  Remember to constantly test, though, because sometimes there are composite problems with multiple plugins, or the theme and a plugin.</p>
<p>Do you have any WordPress bug horror stories you can share? Who solves your site&#8217;s bugs and problems—is it you?</p>

<p>This has been a profitable move for me, but has also been one that has meant making a fairly significant mind shift in the way that I operate. In fact, it&#8217;s probably more accurate to describe it as a series of smaller mind shifts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not alone—in talking to many bloggers who are making a similar transition, I&#8217;m seeing a number of questions come up again and again that indicate to me that we&#8217;re all having to jump over the same hurdles.</p>
<p>One of those hurdles is money-back guarantees.</p>
<p>I spoke with a blogger just yesterday about this—they shot me an email asking whether they should offer a guarantee on their ebook&#8217;s sales page. Their concern was that in offering a virtual product which could not be physically returned people would take advantage of the guarantee: they&#8217;d pay for the product, download it, and then ask for a refund to get what would end up being a free ebook.</p>
<p>I remember wondering the same thing when when I created my own sales pages for the first time. Is offering a money-back guarantee on a virtual product simply setting yourself up to be ripped off?</p>
<h2>Answering the question of money-back guarantees</h2>
<p>Lets start out by saying that you will certainly find that a very small percentage of people <em>will</em> probably take advantage of this refund to get a free product. I&#8217;ve been selling ebooks for a couple of years now and in the times I&#8217;ve been asked for refunds I&#8217;ve certainly suspected a handful of people doing this—but it&#8217;s a very very small minority.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve seen when it comes to refunds on my own ebooks. In the last two and a half years, I&#8217;ve sold around 40,000 ebooks <a href="http://www.problogger.net/learn/">here on ProBlogger</a> and <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/learn">on Digital Photography School</a>. I don&#8217;t have an exact figure on how many refunds have been requested and given (we refund 100% with no questions asked), but I would estimate that the number is less than 100—at the most it&#8217;d be 150.</p>
<p>The majority of those refunds have been requested for genuine reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>from readers who thought they were buying a real book, not a downloadable file</li>
<li>from readers who felt that the ebooks were too advanced or too easy for them</li>
<li>from readers with download problems (e.g. those on dialup)</li>
<li>from readers who accidentally brought two books.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can tell that many of the requests are genuine from the way that the customers approach the refund; you can see for yourself that others are genuine (in that, for example, they didn&#8217;t attempt to download the product). Either way, refunded sales make up around a quarter of 1% of my total sales. They&#8217;re not very significant.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that even if someone does request a refund with the intent of getting a free ebook, it doesn&#8217;t actually cost you anything more than a moment for you to process a refund. That&#8217;s a sale you&#8217;d never have had anyway, and if the person actually does read the ebook, they may just become a fan if what you&#8217;ve written is worthwhile.</p>
<p>On the flip-side I think offering a money-back guarantee comes with some pluses.</p>
<h3>1. A money-back guarantee removes a barrier to purchase</h3>
<p>I know for a fact that at least a proportion of my readers buy my ebooks because they know that if they don&#8217;t like them, they can get their money back. I regularly receive emails, see tweets, and get comments on posts from readers explicitly saying that they liked the idea of being able to taste and see before being committed to the purchase.</p>
<h3>2. A money-back guarantee can help build trust</h3>
<p>The web is a place where people are rightly suspicious. Having a money-back guarantee doesn&#8217;t automatically make people trust you, but it can help to build trust. Your guarantee is an indication to people that you&#8217;re not just after their money, but are interested in providing them with value.</p>
<p>Also, by issuing money back guarantees quickly and without any strings attached, you&#8217;re building a relationship with those who do seek them. Of the 100 or so refunds that I&#8217;ve given over the last couple of years, I often get emails back from people who are impressed with how easy it was, showing relief that I&#8217;m trustworthy, and at times indicating that they&#8217;re going to buy another product of mine that&#8217;s more appropriate to their needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also had quite angry and unsatisfied customers who emailed with dissatisfaction turned around when I offered to refund their money. I often communicate to readers who complain that I&#8217;d rather them be satisfied and happy with my company and not have their money, than have them unhappy and have their $20. I&#8217;ve also seen people publicly tweet or leave comments about how my sites are trustworthy because we issued refunds.</p>
<p>Refunds are an opportunity to build trust and goodwill with customers and readers.</p>
<h3>3. Money-back guarantees differentiate you from the competition</h3>
<p>Not everyone offers a guarantee (at least, not everyone promotes that they do). This provides an opportunity for you to differentiate yourself from the competition.</p>
<p>This was illustrated by an email that I received from a reader of dPS recently who told me that they&#8217;d bought our <a href="http://www.digital-photography-school.com/shots">new ebook</a> instead of a real, hard-cover book from Amazon because they saw our refund policy and didn&#8217;t feel that they&#8217;d be able to return a real book to Amazon.</p>
<p>If a person has the choice of two products (virtual or real) and one will give the buyer a refund if they&#8217;re not satisfied, it could just be that guarantee that gets that customer over the line.</p>
<h3>4. Money-back guarantees drive you to produce value</h3>
<p>One of the side-effects of offering a money-back guarantee is that it keeps you accountable to your readers and customers. I remember having this conversation with an author who was in the process of writing an ebook several months ago&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: I&#8217;m worried about offering a money back guarantee. Won&#8217;t that lead to lost sales?</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: It could, but most people only ask for it if they&#8217;re genuinely unhappy with the product.</p>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: I guess that means I better make it good!</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m sure the author would have done a good job one way or another, he expressed to me six months later, after the ebook was launched, that our short exchange had motivated him to put extra effort into developing his ebook. The threat of lost sales made him more accountable to his potential customers.</p>
<h2>Why guarantees are worth it</h2>
<p>Summing up, I offer money back guarantees of my info products because:</p>
<ul>
<li>they don&#8217;t cost me anything</li>
<li>they do lead to higher sales</li>
<li>they do help me build trust and relationships with readers</li>
<li>I think it&#8217;s a good business and ethical way to be</li>
<li>they keep me accountable to deliver value to those who buy them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, I want those I interact with online to get value and I&#8217;d rather not have their money if they don&#8217;t feel that value is delivered.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> There&#8217;s another factor to consider: if you&#8217;re using PayPal, you&#8217;re pretty much forced into giving refunds at times. Buyers can issue a dispute with PayPal within 60 days of a purchase and, in most cases, a refund is granted. I spoke with one ebook seller recently (who&#8217;s a lot bigger than me) who said that they couldn&#8217;t remember a time when PayPal had sided with them in disputes, and refunds were almost always forced on them by PayPal.</p>
