<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking. </p>
<p>You see the title of this post and you see who wrote it and you just might assume that I&#8217;m going to ask everyone to join hands and sing Kumbaya. <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/kumbaya-blogging/">Again.</a></p>
<p>Maybe you figure that idealism is all well and good for pink-haired bleeding hearts, but it doesn&#8217;t pay the bills.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s great to donate and volunteer and do <em>pro bono</em> work &#8230; later. Right now, you&#8217;re trying to make the cashflow work. Right now, you need to take care of your family. Idealism is going to have to wait until you can afford it.</p>
<p>I totally understand this line of thinking, because I used to think the same way. The only problem is, getting trapped in this mindset will keep you broke.</p>
<p><span id="more-14576"></span>Because if you think that idealism is something that you choose<em> instead of </em>making money, you&#8217;re kind of missing the boat.</p>
<h3>How to make more money</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you increase your business&#8217;s bottom line? </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> You get more customers, or you start charging a price that generates more profit.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> But <em>how</em> do you do either (or both) of those things?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> You find a way to help more prospects to become customers, or you do a better job helping your existing customers. </p>
<p>The bigger the problem you can solve or the more people you can solve it for, the more money you stand to make. That&#8217;s the fundamental principle behind a good value proposition. Simple, even if it isn&#8217;t always easy.</p>
<h3>Where we can sometimes go off track</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, it gets hard. No matter how great your ideas or how mad your skills, you&#8217;ll have some tough weeks.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when it can be easy to decide that the whole &#8220;being good&#8221; thing can wait for a better week to come along. </p>
<p>You know what happens next. Companies start to cut corners, or abuse their employees (who then go on to abuse their customers). What used to be cool and delightful gets a little &#8230; less delightful.</p>
<p>Those companies aren&#8217;t evil. (Well, most of them aren&#8217;t.) They&#8217;re just focused &#8212; just like you might be. </p>
<p>When you want and need money, you focus on what can make more of it for you. And if you aren&#8217;t careful, you can forget that the best way to increase profits is to help more people. </p>
<p>You might start to make decisions based on spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Which is another way to say you start to make decisions based on fear.</p>
<p>You ask, &#8220;How can we make these numbers add up in a better way?&#8221; And when you do that, the idealistic vision you started with begins to look like a <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/naive/">naive</a> dead end.</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s talk about a real business</h3>
<p>Is it a good financial move to pay four or five times the going rate for African jewelry if you want to resell it in America? </p>
<p>Business 101 says we&#8217;ve got to control costs. Helping the vendors or artists you buy from is nice if you&#8217;re a billionaire with good hair like Richard Branson. But it looks pretty unrelated to your business&#8217;s profitability. </p>
<p>But take a look at what <a href="http://keza.com" target="_blank">Keza</a> does every single time it works with an artist in, for example, Rwanda. They do, in fact, pay their artists more than the going rate. A lot more. And they make a big profit on every sale. </p>
<p>The artists win. Keza wins. And the win is bigger than that, because Keza&#8217;s two missions are to improve Africa&#8217;s image in the eyes of the West (eyes that are used to only seeing misery and disease in charity commercials) and to bring the continent some of that &#8220;trade, not aid&#8221; that Nelson Mandela and Bono keep talking about.</p>
<p>Keza could have leveraged the different costs of living, as many companies do, for easy profit. Paid the street value of pennies and come back home to sell the necklaces for dollars. </p>
<p>From the spreadsheet perspective, that would have made good financial sense. Spend less, make more. Worry about profits now; worry about helping Africa later.</p>
<p>That gets you to being Cost Plus. Which is, I&#8217;m sure, a perfectly nice company. But it&#8217;s not a remarkable one.</p>
<p>Keza is nothing like Cost Plus.</p>
<p>Keza gets its jewelry into red carpet events, and luxury stores like Barney&#8217;s. They&#8217;re not chasing the lowest common denominator &#8212; they&#8217;re finding work that&#8217;s exceptional, and delivering it to the wealthiest buyers on the planet.</p>
<p>Keza has a better product, and it tells a better story. </p>
<p>Without Keza&#8217;s idealistic mission, its great win-win-win story, <em>and</em> a superior product, could it achieve the high status and esteem required to sell at those high prices?</p>
<h3>The perfect balance: Profitable Idealism</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve read any of my posts or taken my courses, you know I&#8217;m big on win-win. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not willing to &#8220;leverage&#8221; when that means that I make a lot and someone else gets a crummy deal. I don&#8217;t feel good if my kid is thriving at the expense of someone else&#8217;s kid. </p>
<p>In fact, my kind of thinking led a lot of people to tell me I&#8217;d never be really successful &#8212; that I didn&#8217;t have the killer instinct.</p>
<p>No one tells me that any more. <em>(Not, you know, that I&#8217;d gloat or anything. Because that would be wrong.)</em></p>
<p>So ANYWAY, when our own Johnny B. Truant and fellow Copyblogger contributor Pace Smith announced <em><a href="http://profitableidealism.com?AFFID=53353">Profitable Idealism</a></em>, I may or may not have attempted some celebratory cartwheels. It wasn&#8217;t very dignified, but fortunately no one was watching except the cat.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s Profitable Idealism?</h3>
<p><em>Profitable Idealism</em> is a comprehensive guide to creating a business that makes money (maybe even big money) <em>and</em> makes the world a better place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known Johnny and Pace for a couple of years now, and I think they&#8217;re the right people to teach this course. They both have highly profitable businesses, and they both have a mission to change the world in their own unique way. (They&#8217;ve also brought in a bunch of brainy, wise folks to help teach the course &#8212; I know nearly everyone involved, and they&#8217;re all amazing.)</p>
<p>Johnny started with the profit side of things and Pace began as an idealist, but they ended up in the same place: with businesses that succeed because they&#8217;re focused not just inward, but also outward. </p>
<p>They put <em>Profitable Idealism</em> together because there&#8217;s more to creating a profitable idealist business than just slapping a charitable venture on top of your existing business. If you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing, you&#8217;ll end up with an &#8220;idealist&#8221; side that drains time and money from your business instead of bolstering it. Or, you&#8217;ll end up doing a lot of good, but will find yourself unsatisfied and unable to find the true win-win that allows you to make any money for yourself. </p>
<p>Pace, Johnny, and their six detailed case studies (Jared Angaza from Keza is one of them) can show you how to do it right, so that you end up with an entity that truly helps everyone &#8230; including you. </p>
<p>(And if you don&#8217;t put yourself into the equation, my friend, that&#8217;s not idealism … it&#8217;s just being a chump.)</p>

<p>This Monday was Valentine&#8217;s Day, which is one of those rare days my wife Robin and I go out without the kids and then realize that we&#8217;ve forgotten how to converse without being constantly interrupted. </p>
<p>So, in an attempt at some sense of normalcy, I started banging my silverware on the table and demanding to be taken to the bathroom every five minutes. Then I ordered something we both knew I wouldn&#8217;t eat and played with it while Robin negotiated with me for three more bites. Eventually we got tired, threw my congealed mac and cheese in a styrofoam box, and dropped it in the parking lot before going home reasonably content.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/know-like-trust/">Need More Customers? 5 Ways to Get Them to Know, Like, and Trust You</a></strong></p>
<p>This post is essentially about how to date your customer. While I agree with this as a metaphor (getting your customers to like you), I think it&#8217;s a bad idea when put into practice. First of all, if you want more than one customer, someone is bound to get jealous. Second, you&#8217;re going to have to watch a lot of bad romantic comedies. And third, who&#8217;s going to pick up the check when you go out? Because you know that&#8217;s going to be awkward.</p>

<p>The Social Eyes theme for the Genesis framework on WordPress is great and easy to use and has all of the SEO benefits you know and love, but more importantly, its name will remind you of the Hall and Oates song &#8220;Private Eyes.&#8221; And am I crazy, or does Daryl Oates look exactly like Gary &#8220;Baba Booey&#8221; Dell&#8217;Abate from <em>The Howard Stern Show</em>? </p>

<p>Aside from the continuing implication that romance with customers is a good idea, this post really makes you think (in a good way, not in a &#8220;why is that man wearing a tortoise?&#8221; way) about the best way to approach prospecting and sales. Do you go in like a love-struck doofus or plan things out a bit? I prefer the former, but apparently that&#8217;s not correct.</p>

<p>Jeers to this latest episode of the IMfSP podcast for not being about love AT ALL, but instead being about Groupon, which I still don&#8217;t understand even a little bit. Apparently if you listen to this, you&#8217;ll see how you may not need Groupon, but what does that have to do with <em>amour</em>? Maybe it&#8217;s a typo, and the podcast is about a service called &#8220;Gropeon.&#8221; As in, &#8220;Get your grope on.&#8221; That would be lovely.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/reader-love/">5 Hot Tips to Make Your Readers Fall in Love</a></strong></p>
<p>TGIF, because I&#8217;m running out of jokes about love, dating, and groping. So instead, I&#8217;ll just mention that this post is full of good tips to get your readers to really love you, like to totally get out of the &#8220;friend zone&#8221; and get serious. And then for the joke, I&#8217;ll sit here and make armpit noises. </p>

<p>You’ve tried to get their attention. You’ve read the right books, listened to all the gurus, and freshened up your appearance, but it’s not working.</p>
<p>You aren’t being noticed by the one you love. Your ideal customer isn’t giving you the time of day. They&#8217;re ignoring your offers. All of your overtures are rebuffed. </p>
<p><strong><em>They’re just not that into you.</em></strong></p>
<p>To wrap up Valentine’s week here on Copyblogger, we’re going to cover how to flirt with potential customers, <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/hold-reader-attention/">get their attention</a>, and make them fall head over heels with your product or service. It’s a five-part technique that &#8212; when implemented together &#8212; will attract the most resistant customer.</p>
<p><span id="more-14472"></span></p>
<h3>1. Make yourself desirable</h3>
<p>Want to capture your potential customer’s attention? Give them what they’re looking for.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hunger is the best sauce.<br />~ Italian proverb</p></blockquote>
<p>Share valuable information, and <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/copywriting-offers/">make sure you’re offering what they <em>actually</em> want</a>. You can do that by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking your search stats to see what terms people use to find your site, </li>
<li>Using sites like Twitter and Facebook to &#8220;listen in&#8221; to conversations about what buyers in your niche want, and</li>
<li>Observing what people actually buy (rather than what they think they would buy).</li>
</ul>
<p>High-quality information will establish your expertise and build your authority over time, and <em>that</em> is irresistible.</p>
<h3>2. Show them the goods</h3>
<p>You’ve captured their attention with your valuable, optimized content. Now it’s time to get their number so you can stay in touch.</p>
<p>Forget about all those cheap pick up lines you learned in high school. (Or the equally cheap lines that are still taught by sales trainers who apparently think we&#8217;re going door to door with vacuum cleaners.)</p>
<p>Instead, dangle something in front of your audience that they’ll find so useful, so compelling, and so tempting they’ll be rushing to type their e-mail address in your opt-in form.</p>
<p>Offer a <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/sell-without-a-sales-pitch/">solution to a problem</a>, or a series of tips. Create a guide or checklist for getting something accomplished. Give them access to a free audio or video product.</p>
<p>It’s the first step in a <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/generate-sales-leads/">sales funnel</a> that will lead them along from free, to entry-level, moving through mid-range and on to the top of your price range. A really good free offer will make them fall right into the top of your funnel before they know what’s hit them.</p>
<h3>3. Surprise them (in a good way)</h3>
<p>Once they’ve signed up for your free offer, surprise them with the high value content you keep delivering. This is the ideal time to establish that you are a class act, and make it known you won’t let them down.</p>
<p>Deliver superior quality content, and present it in a professional-looking package. If it&#8217;s blog content, <a href="http://www.studiopress.com/features">make sure your site looks great and works perfectly</a>. If it’s an e-book, take the time to design it well. If it’s an email auto-responder, create a template that&#8217;s polished and easy to read. If it’s audio or video, deliver it with the best production values you can muster.</p>
<p>Because they’re watching your every move at this point. You have their attention. Don’t blow it.</p>
<h3>4. Respond to their overtures</h3>
<p>After you’ve done steps 1 through 3, some &#8212; <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/dangerous-feedback/">not all</a> &#8212; of your audience will respond to your customer flirtation techniques.</p>
<p>You might start to get blog comments, Twitter DMs or e-mails sent from your website.</p>
<p>When the messages come in, be sure to respond promptly and professionally. Don’t leave your prized customer hanging!</p>
<p>Show potential customers they can count on you to be responsive and trustworthy. Let them know you’ll be there when they need you.</p>
<h3>5. Stay faithful</h3>
<p>The last step? Repeat the first four over and over.</p>
<p>Consistent, high-quality content delivered over time will establish you as a reliable, authoritative source of information. “Getting their number” and staying in touch (via an email or RSS subscription) will allow you to continue the courting process. And reliable, responsive customer service will seal the deal.</p>
<p>When it’s time to swoop in and <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/101-conversion-boosters/">make the sale</a>, the stage will be set. Your customers will be all warmed up and ready for action. These techniques will make it easy to sweep them off their feet.</p>
<p>Before you know it, they’ll be in your arms with wallets open &#8212; captivated by your content, smitten with your services, and carrying a torch for your products.</p>

<p>At some point in your life, you’ve had one. I’ve had one. Everyone’s had one. </p>
<p>I’m talking, of course, about a really awkward, torturous, embarrassing first date. </p>
<p>You misread a cue and leaned forward for a kiss when your date was just reaching forward to grab their laptop bag.</p>
<p>You find yourself with nothing to say for a full ninety minutes, and sit in agonizing silence as you get increasingly desperate looking for a way out.</p>
<p>The agony of a bad date for most people is matched only by the agony of a really bad sales call. Thankfully, I’ve got a few methods that will help you avoid both. </p>
<p><span id="more-13738"></span>Just like <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/know-like-trust/">customer relationships</a>, selling and dating have some striking similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you really, really need a sale (or a date) the likelihood of you getting some action drops significantly</li>
<li>If you have the thought “I have to make this one work,” in the first interaction, you will crash and burn</li>
<li>Self-confident individuals who enjoy the process have the best outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>Early on in my consulting business, I had the good fortune to work with Skip Miller, experienced sales trainer and author of <em>ProActive Selling</em>. </p>
<p>Skip helped me to get over my own fear of selling by teaching me the natural steps in the sales process that totally match the needs of your prospective customer. </p>
<h3>Step One: Initiate</h3>
<p>This is the very first time that you meet a prospect. It could be an in-person meeting or an online one. Maybe you ran into this person at a networking event, maybe you’re looking at their website, but this is the first impression each of you is making on the other. During that time, there is only one important question you need to answer:   </p>
<p><strong><em>Is there a reason to keep talking?</strong></em></p>
<p>If you and your prospect have a lot in common or complementary interests and needs, it’s likely one or both of you is interested in taking things to the next level. Calmly and confidently invite them to meet with you formally &#8212; kind of like a first date. </p>
<p>In a professional sales situation, this goes something like this: </p>
<blockquote><p>It was great meeting you, Tom. From what you described about your event, I may have some more ideas for marketing and promotion. Do you want to chat more about it next week? When would be a good time?</p></blockquote>
<p>Online, you can initiate that same meeting by inviting them to “Call me to learn more” or “Send us an email to set up a free consult.” </p>
<p>If there&#8217;s no chemistry, there is no need to play out an awkward sales version of a dating dance, where you politely agree to first, second and third meetings even when you both know that you don’t have much to offer one another. Tell this prospect that you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re a good fit for the project, and wish them luck finding the right person.</p>
<p>And if you happen to know someone who might be a better choice, go ahead and set them up with a simple referral. “The project isn&#8217;t a good fit for me, but my friend Suzanne might be excellent for you &#8212; would you like her number/website?” </p>
<p>In dating and in sales, there’s no point in wasting time when you aren&#8217;t right for each other. After all, there are plenty of fish in the sea. In fact, the goal of an effective sales process is to get <em>rid</em> of bad fits as quickly as you can, so that you can continue to fill your sales funnel with more qualified prospects. </p>
<h3>Step Two: Educate</h3>
<p>While you’re actually on that first date (a phone meeting, consult over coffee, lengthy email exchange), you’re in the Educate stage. This is when you’re going to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Learn as much as possible about your prospect’s situation</li>
<li>Find out if he has the money and time to work with you</li>
<li>Determine if you could deliver value to him with your solution</li>
</ul>
<p>While you’re finding all of this out, be on the lookout for any information they’re asking for that is above and beyond “first date” material. </p>
<p>For example, if you were on your first date with a nice person who abruptly asked whether you’d like to have kids, that might be a bit of a red flag. After all, you haven’t even determined yet whether you’re enough of a match to consider kids. </p>
<p>Similarly, if someone asks you for a price quote or proposal before you’ve had the time to get a full background on their situation, it should raise some alarm bells. First you need to learn a little more about one another so you can find out if more serious planning is in the offing. That’s what the Educate stage is for. </p>
<p>Good questions to ask while you’re “dating” a prospect: </p>
<ol>
<li>What do they want to do?</li>
<li>Why do they want to do it?</li>
<li>When does it need to get done?</li>
<li>What will change for the better in their life or business if they work with you?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/keys-to-success/">What does success look like</a> in their view?</li>
</ol>
<p>And in turn, they’ll want to find out from you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you really deliver on your promise?</li>
<li>Do you have the capability and resources to solve their problem?</li>
<li>What have you done for others before?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/are-you-trustworthy/">Are you trustworthy?</a></li>
<li>How do you work?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/pricing-freelance-writing/">What do you charge?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In the online businessworld, you’ll be communicating this information to each other in all kinds of ways, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>A phone call/email</li>
<li>A detailed “intake” form on your website where you ask specific questions to potential clients</li>
<li>Research on websites, Twitter, LinkedIn profiles, and/or Facebook pages to see what they are about and who they connect with (note that this works for both sides)</li>
<li>Well-organized case studies, samples, or testimonials on your website</li>
<li>Google searches</li>
<li>Talking with your past clients or customers (and remember, for better or worse, Twitter makes it easy to find past clients who’ve worked with you)</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the <em>Educate</em> stage, you should have a pretty clear idea whether the two of you are a good fit for one another. If you sense they feel the same way, you can confidently invite them to the next step of the sales process, <em>Validate</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can make the same graceful retreat we talked about in the <em>Initiate</em> section &#8212; say you don’t think you’re a good fit, and possibly recommend them to someone who might be a better match. </p>
<h3>Step 3: Validate</h3>
<p>At this point, the relationship is beginning to take shape. Now it’s time to make sure you’re both on the same page. </p>
<p>Though you’ve gathered lots of information during the <em>Educate</em> stage, you’ll to clearly lay out exactly what you expect from the relationship and what they’re expecting from you. </p>
<p>It’s time to decide if you can make a commitment. So lay out in an easy-to-understand format like a project proposal: </p>
<ul>
<li>The scope of the work</li>
<li>The specific value and benefit of the work (return on investment, saved time, reduced risk, <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/irresistible-brand/">better brand</a>, etc)</li>
<li>Roles and responsibilities (what they&#8217;ll give you, what you&#8217;ll give them)</li>
<li>A specific time frame for the project</li>
</ul>
<p>In dating, this step often shows up some holes in the relationship &#8212; you want to see him twice a week, he wants to see you every day. Arguments ensue. </p>
<p>To avoid arguments in your professional relationships at the <em>Validate</em> stage, put everything in writing and make sure you’re clear before moving forward. </p>
<p>If some disagreement comes up during this point in the proceedings, don&#8217;t make the mistake of compromising too much. If the price is not working for your client but you are not willing to lower it, that’s a dealbreaker. Time to nicely end the relationship and point the prospect toward another potential match who might be willing to meet their terms. </p>
<h3>Step 4: Justify</h3>
<p>Now that you both know you’re serious about this business relationship, it’s time to make a proposal. </p>
<p>There are a number of ways to <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/sales-page-elements/">ask for the sale</a>, but <em>you</em> need to be the one to ask. If you’re waiting around for the prospect to ask you if they can give you money, you’ll be waiting a long time. </p>
<p>Here are a few ways to ask for that sale: </p>
<ul>
<li>Send a formal proposal</li>
<li>Include a payment link in an email</li>
<li>Send them to a page on your website where they can purchase what you are offering</li>
<li>Describe the offer with the full benefits and value proposition in a sales letter</li>
<li>Direct them to a very clear “Purchase” button</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 5: Decide</h3>
<p>The purpose of the last step in the sales process is to ask for a decision, Yes or No.</p>
<p>Although it seems like a small detail, it actually causes a lot of stress for people new to sales. (And maybe for you.)</p>
<p>The problem is, if you don’t ask for a decision, your prospect floats out to what Skip Miller calls “Maybe Land” &#8212; they have your proposal, you think they want to work with you, they know exactly what they need to do to make a purchasing decision … but they’re not getting back to you.</p>
<p>In relationships, this is a little bit like someone saying they need “space.” </p>
<p>You sit and stare at your phone, refresh your email twenty-two times a minute, and slowly go from strong, confident ninja to insecure, miserable failure. </p>
<p>Take control. If you didn’t get a firm yes or no, nicely let them know that you’ll need to move on if they can’t make up their mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tom, I sent you a proposal for our project. In order to meet your deadline for April 15, we need to make a decision if this is a go by February 21.  If we decide later than that, I am not sure I can fit you into my production schedule.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what happens if February 21 comes and goes and you don’t have a decision?</p>
<p>Move on. Consider that this project is in <em>Maybe Land</em>, and it may never get out. </p>
<p>You may want to chill out and wait to see if they get back to you in a day or two. Or you could go back to the <em>Educate</em> stage and make sure that you have clearly communicated the scope and value of your offer.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, do not call or email them every day.  You are worth more than that! Get out there and meet someone new &#8212; someone who can hold up their half of the relationship.</p>
<p>Desperation was never good for dating, and it is worse for selling.</p>
<p>Happy Valentine’s week!</p>

<p><em>It’s Valentine’s week on Copyblogger! This week’s posts will focus on how to improve reader and customer relationships to grow your business.</em></p>
<p>Dating and business are both all about forming relationships. You need to get out there and be seen. You need to “romance” potential customers and get them comfortable with what you have to offer. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been in business for a while, you&#8217;ve probably heard the concept of <strong><em>know, like, and trust</em></strong>. Salespeople often talk about it as a lead-generating tactic used before the sale. Good salespeople know that a prospect needs to know, like and trust you before she&#8217;s willing to complete the sale. And it&#8217;s a key component of good <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/content-marketing/">content marketing</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-14140"></span>But the most important moment for know, like and trust isn&#8217;t before the sale &#8230; it&#8217;s after.</p>
<h3>Creating more love &#8230; when it counts</h3>
<p>Everything&#8217;s all roses and candy during the romantic &#8220;does he like me?&#8221; courting phase. And any competent salesperson gives “great customer service” before the sale. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s what happens the day after that <em>really</em> matters.</p>
<p>Here are five ways <strong><em>know, like, and trust</em></strong> works during and after the &#8220;transaction&#8221; in both business and dating. </p>
<p>(And for any readers who have been striking out romantically, these tips just might come in handy there as well.) </p>
<h3>1. Go beyond small talk</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been married for a long time and my husband has given me insights on how scary it is for guys to ask women out on a date. No one likes rejection.</p>
<p>You can go into a lot of bars, but if you actually want a date, eventually you&#8217;re going to have to get beyond small talk and ask someone out.</p>
<p>Making small talk in business is easy. You give away all that fabulous <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/create-better-content/">cookie content</a> and have a good time chatting up commenters on Facebook, twitter, and your blog. </p>
<p>But eventually you have to <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/ask/">ask for the sale</a>. If you don&#8217;t, you aren&#8217;t in business, you have an expensive hobby. And those don’t pay the mortgage.</p>
<h3>2. Don&#8217;t mess up the big moment</h3>
<p>The person of your dreams says Yes &#8212; she actually will go out with you! </p>
<p>You feel fantastic about yourself and walk around like a proud peacock.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t screw it up. Do not take the object of your affections to a grimy dive bar for your first date. Or to your mom’s basement to watch Biggest Loser. </p>
<p>Go somewhere nice. Make a great first impression.</p>
<p>In business, when someone finally says Yes and clicks the magical <em>Add to Cart</em> button, everything needs to work seamlessly. </p>
<p>A bad shopping cart experience kills sales. </p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your site looks reasonably professional, with user-friendly design that conveys authority.</li>
<li>Check your links. (All of them.) (Especially the <em>Buy</em> ones.)</li>
<li>Make sure your online check-out actually takes people through the process quickly and easily.</li>
<li>And make sure you’ve got a great support system (this might be you, in the early days) in place to handle transactions that have issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. If things don&#8217;t work out, be gracious</h3>
<p>So you go on your date and discover, Gee, although the guy does have all his teeth, he&#8217;s also got the personality of a Western Conifer Seed Bug. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been on bad dates. It happens. When both of you agree that you have nothing in common and it&#8217;s time to move on, don&#8217;t be a jerk about it.</p>
<p>In much the same way, in your business life, some people who buy your products will hate them. Don&#8217;t make them hate you too. Offer a <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/strong-guarantee/">strong money-back guarantee</a>, and be as gracious about returns as you were about the purchase.</p>
<h3>4. Don&#8217;t lie</h3>
<p>Almost every woman I&#8217;ve ever met has a story about the guy she dated who didn&#8217;t opt to reveal some important facts about himself. </p>
<p>Leaving out important information like &#8220;I&#8217;m married,” “I just robbed a bank and am on the lam,” or “I&#8217;m from the future” is a sure way to ensure a really ugly breakup. Bad idea.</p>
<p>When it comes to your business, you need to deliver on what you promised. If you say you are going to provide 10 Q&#038;A calls in your training program, that means you have to get on the phone 10 times. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t promise stuff you can&#8217;t deliver. It&#8217;s a sure way to kill trust. Word gets out about that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Sure, sometimes it’s really hard to honor your promises. That’s business. (And love.) Cowboy up.</p>
<h3>5. Follow up</h3>
<p>Assuming you go on a date, and maybe even more than one, eventually there&#8217;s that magic moment where you make the big connection. In the movies, we&#8217;d just fade to black here, but I think you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where <em><strong>know, like, and trust</strong></em> gets really important. </p>
<p>The day after, give her a call. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll be branded a schmuck forever.</p>
<p>Wham, bam, thank you ma&#8217;am doesn&#8217;t work well in business either. No customer wants to feel like a one-night stand.</p>
<p>Yes, you can use marketing techniques upsells and cross-sells, but that’s not the only way to follow up. Don’t underestimate how big an impression you can make just by saying Thank you. </p>
<p>When your customers know you care, they stay customers.</p>
<p>After the sale, the customer who knows, likes and trusts you is far more likely to buy from you again. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s how you build a business (or a romantic) relationship that lasts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been hard at work this week on <a href="http://profitableidealism.com"><em>Profitable Idealism</em></a>, my new venture with Pace Smith, who coincidentally wrote Thursday&#8217;s post below.

<p>So maybe you&#8217;ll end up with a Ferrari, and I&#8217;ll get an all red billiard room with a giant stuffed camel and a disco room with my own disco dancers. I&#8217;m giddy just thinking about it&#8230; this must be what Santa feels like!</p>
<p><span id="more-14456"></span>Before you go check that out, here&#8217;s what happened this week on Copyblogger:</p>
<h3>Monday:</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/low-social-iq/">Is Your Low Social IQ Dooming Your Blog?</a></strong></p>
<p>This post poses two alternate questions. The first one is the question we bloggers tend to ask when things aren&#8217;t working: &#8220;My work is brilliant. Is the problem that everyone else is an idiot?&#8221; And the second question is about what the problem actually might be: &#8220;Are you, dear blogger, more socially inept than a 40-year-old, basement-dwelling, sci-fi fanatic momma&#8217;s boy?&#8221; But snark aside, you&#8217;d better pay attention. Your social and personal skills might just be what could turn your content from misunderstood genius into popular brain candy. </p>

<h3>Tuesday:</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/direct-mail-for-copywriters/">Want More Copywriting Clients? Here’s a Surprising Way to Find Them</a></strong></p>
<p>This post disappointed me. Not because of the content, which is a really good explanation of a prospecting method that nobody ever thinks of anymore, but because the title had me expecting something truly shocking. Like finding clients underneath your porch, or locating them by randomly kicking people in the crotch until someone hires you. I&#8217;d be way more surprised to get work either of those two ways.</p>

<h3>Wednesday:</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/split-testing/">The Guaranteed Way to Radically Improve Your Copywriting</a></strong></p>
<p>I figure I can reveal the fact that this post is about split testing here, in this teaser, if I don&#8217;t reveal how exactly you&#8217;re supposed to go about it. Which is good because that opens me up to the wide spectrum of split-related jokes, including doing the splits (and subsequent groin injuries), banana splits (not sure how that&#8217;s funny; I&#8217;d have to work at it), and the way Schwarzenegger sliced &#8220;Buzzsaw&#8221; up the middle in <em>The Running Man</em> and said, &#8220;He had to split.&#8221; Oh, and you can also improve your copywriting somehow here. I don&#8217;t know; read the post. </p>

<h3>Thursday:</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/better-converting-copy/">How to Legally Steal Copy That Converts Like Crazy</a></strong></p>
<p>This aforementioned post by the aforementioned Pace Smith is all about getting your customers to help you do your copywriting, and we&#8217;re using it for our aforementioned new course. But really, it got me wondering whether <em>any</em> copy can truly hope to convert like crazy. Crazy flat-out <em>works</em>. I remember a time I was on the Philadelphia subway and this guy wearing a toilet seat around his neck said, &#8220;Ham beats the president, I&#8217;ll tell you what,&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;Dude, I am absolutely signing up for your newsletter.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Friday:</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/be-the-hero/">Why Everyone Hopes You’ll Be the Hero</a></strong></p>
<p>This post is a cool little bit of Friday inspiration about how even if you think the world is against you, people are really rooting for you. <strong>Side note:</strong> For some reason, at first I thought the <em>faux</em> Post-It note accompanying this post said, &#8220;I am a fan of the morons.&#8221; I&#8217;m not even making that up to try to be funny. </p>

<p>I walked into the small, yellow audition room and stopped twelve feet in front of the cheap plastic fold-out table.</p>
<p>There were three of them sitting in there, bored, distracted, glancing at their watches.</p>
<p>The big heart inside my chest was pounding on the rib cage, hoping this was the one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, uh &#8230;. Mr. <em>Bruise</em> is it?&#8221; No. 1 said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s actually <em>Bruce</em>, but thank you, I &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, what do you have for us today?&#8221; No. 3 said.</p>
<p><span id="more-13524"></span>He was looking down, rustling some outstandingly important paperwork into some sort of crucial order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you, I, I&#8217;ll be doing a short monologue from Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Twelfth Night</em> and another from Sean Penn&#8217;s turn in <em>Carlito&#8217;s Way</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard one of them groan under his breath.</p>
<p>With sweat pouring down my chest and into the front of my new shirt from Ross, I began acting like nobodies motherf***ing business &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, thank you, that was beautiful, that was really well done. You&#8217;re beautiful Bruise, we&#8217;ll call you &#8230;&#8221; No. 2 said.</p>
<p>I walked out onto the street, and into six more years of small yellow rooms, fold-out tables, and &#8220;We&#8217;ll call you &#8230;&#8221; promises.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d gambled it all, and at 30 ended up humiliated, broke, and directionless.</p>
<p>Years later, after my time in Hollywood was over, I was sitting next to a very old man at a bus stop. We chatted for a few minutes, turns out he&#8217;d been an extremely successful businessman in the midwest.</p>
<p>I told him my experiences, my many failures in work, and he listened patiently. </p>
<p>Then he uttered something that changed the way I looked at work, success, failure, and everything else related to human industry &#8212; forever.</p>
<p class="alert">&#8220;You know, those casting directors really wanted <em>you</em> to be the one they were looking for. They weren&#8217;t against you, they were waiting for you to nail it, so they could pack up and get back to their martinis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Think about this. Think about why you don&#8217;t start.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/cowardly-entrepreneur/">You&#8217;re afraid</a>, which wrecks your ability to execute.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/whats-your-excuse/">You&#8217;re full of excuses</a>, which kills your idea before it&#8217;s born.</p>
<p>You think buyers, or readers, or clients, or investors are <em>against you</em>, which makes you unfit for fighting.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably not a twenty-something trying to make it in Hollywood (neither am I, anymore).</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;re 65, and starting a freelance marketing shop.</p>
<p>Or you&#8217;re 43 and and you want to build your first iPhone app.</p>
<p>You might feel that the world, your circumstances, and your past are all staring you in the face, mocking you. Telling you it&#8217;s no use, might as well throw it in.</p>
<p>Truth is, every person and company in this world <em>wants you to rescue them</em>. They&#8217;re just waiting, hoping you, or your product, or your service, is the hero that finally solves their problem or fulfills their desire. They hope you&#8217;re the hero they&#8217;ve been waiting for <em>all this time</em>.</p>
<p>You may not feel it, and they certainly won&#8217;t tell you, but it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p class="alert">&#8220;You know, those customers really want <em>your product</em> to be the one they&#8217;ve been looking for. They aren&#8217;t against you, they&#8217;re waiting for you to nail it, to solve their problem, so they can get on with their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>You might fall flat, you might make an exquisite failure, but don&#8217;t let worry or nervousness about how your &#8220;thing&#8221; will be received stop you.</p>
<p>Do your research, know your lines cold, practice daily, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/06/fear-of-shipping.html">and then ship it</a>.</p>
<p>Go make it. Be the hero.</p>

<p>Everyone knows better copy gets you more buyers, but professional copywriters are ridiculously expensive for a bootstrapped business, right?</p>
<p>And of course every entrepreneur should study copywriting, but it takes time to get really good. You want a great sales page today, not in three years when you&#8217;ve finally read all those copywriting books on your bedside table.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you could get high-quality copy that converts &#8212; <em>for free</em>?</p>
<p>Well, you can.</p>
<p><span id="more-13965"></span>I&#8217;d like to share a process with you that&#8217;s straightforward, completely legal (and ethical), and won&#8217;t cost you a penny. We now use it in our business for every product we create, and it&#8217;s created fantastic results for us.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Survey your customers</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by creating a survey. <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> forms work well and are totally free.</p>
<p>Write a one-paragraph overview of your product, then ask your customers just two questions:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Given what you know so far, make a guess: would you buy this product?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>and </p>
<p><strong>&#8220;What problem do you expect this product to solve for you?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re selling an information or teaching product, you can instead phrase the second question as <strong>&#8220;What do you hope to learn from this product?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Use a text box for the second question, but limit the first to preset options to something like: no / probably not / maybe / probably / yes</p>
<p>Include a note saying that by submitting a survey response, the respondent authorizes you to use it for any purpose.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Throw out the non-buyers</h3>
<p>Sometimes people who respond &#8220;no&#8221; or &#8220;probably not&#8221; will leave interesting comments to the second question, and their feedback can help you position your next offer differently.</p>
<p>For this purpose, however, <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/dangerous-feedback/">ignore them</a>. They won&#8217;t buy, so don&#8217;t let them distract you.</p>
<p>Throw out all the &#8220;no&#8221; and &#8220;probably not&#8221; answers.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Throw out the sure things</h3>
<p>This one may seem a little counterintuitive at first. But your landing page doesn&#8217;t need any copy to convince a &#8220;yes&#8221; to buy &#8212; it just needs a buy button.</p>
<p>The point of a <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/landing-pages/">landing page</a> is to convert &#8220;maybe&#8221; and &#8220;probably&#8221; to &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Set aside the &#8220;yes&#8221; responses and focus only on people who said &#8220;maybe&#8221; and &#8220;probably.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Step 4: Copy and paste.</h3>
<p>Most copywriting is making your best guess at what motivates your customers.</p>
<p>But if you just <em>ask them</em>, you can eliminate the guesswork. Your customers will tell you exactly what motivates them, and then you can repeat it back to them <a href="http://www.remarkable-communication.com/secret-language/">in their own words</a>.</p>
<p>Copy and paste snippets of the remaining responses &#8212; those &#8220;maybe&#8221; and &#8220;probably&#8221; buyers &#8212; into your landing page. These survey responses form the core of your Features and Benefits section.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Rephrase and generalize</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/the-two-most-important-words-in-blogging/">Rephrase &#8220;I&#8221; as &#8220;you&#8221;</a> and &#8220;my&#8221; as &#8220;your.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, if a customer writes, &#8220;I want to know how I can get out of debt,&#8221; you might rephrase as &#8220;<em>You&#8217;ll learn how you can get out of debt</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then take the specifics and make them general enough that your target market will find them relevant. </p>
<p>If you get &#8220;I want to learn how to keep my obnoxious aunt Betty from getting on my case when I visit her for Christmas,&#8221; generalize it to &#8220;<em>You&#8217;ll learn how to keep your obnoxious relatives from getting on your case when you visit them for the holidays</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t generalize too much &#8212; for example, don&#8217;t generalize &#8220;obnoxious&#8221; to &#8220;troublesome,&#8221; or try to find a fancier way to say &#8220;get on your case.&#8221; The whole point of this process is to get your customers&#8217; own words onto your landing page, so only generalize personal things that apply to just one individual.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Profit!</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>When you go directly to your customer, find out the benefits and features they&#8217;re looking for, and use their own words to describe them (and, of course, to be sure those needs are addressed in your product), you&#8217;ll become a marketing genius. You&#8217;ll spend less time writing copy and your conversion rates will soar.</p>
<p>(And of course, you can make it work even better if you <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/split-testing/">split test</a> it.)</p>
<p>How about you &#8212; ever &#8220;legally stolen&#8221; copy from potential customers? What questions did you use? Did you use a survey, twitter searches, your blog comments, or another source?</p>
<p>Let us know about it in the comments!</p>
