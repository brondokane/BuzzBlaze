Over the next few years he opened 20 other stalls around the <span class="caps">UK.</span> In 1894, Thomas Spencer invested in the business and retail chain Marks &amp; Spencer was born. From it&#8217;s humble beginnings <span class="caps">M&amp;S</span>—as it was colloquially called—became one of the <span class="caps">UK&#8217;</span>s biggest success stories and was the first retailer to make a pre-tax profit of over £1 billion. Companies like WH Smith, Woolworth&#8217;s and <span class="caps">AMSTRAD </span>all started the same way, so it would seem that in order to make it big, you should start small. Can the same thing be said of the Web?</p>

<p>As the founder of a relatively <a href="http://clearleft.com/">well known digital design consultancy</a> I&#8217;m often approached by entrepreneurs wanting to start their own online business. I try to help them as much as I can, but I&#8217;m constantly amazed how little they know about the web or the cost of doing business online.</p>

<p>Starting your own online business has definitely got cheaper over the last few years. For instance you no longer need to buy expensive hardware or suffer crippling data costs. It&#8217;s also possible to piggy back off existing technologies and string together open source projects. Even so, setting up a company which you hope will become a multi-million dollar business isn&#8217;t cheap. As such you have to invest in proportion to what you hope to achieve.</p>

<p>I often see entrepreneurs lured by tales of plucky geeks starting their own business on a shoestring and making it big. Movies like Social Network don&#8217;t help quell the myth of the overnight success. The reality is somewhat different, with many of these so-called overnight successes spending 3 or 4 years in the wilderness and burning through hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of dollars before they make it big. More importantly, for every overnight success, we see tens of thousands of start-ups sink without trace. </p>

<p>Popular culture has created the myth that start-ups are cheap—cheaper than regular businesses anyway. This can be true for designers and developers who band together and use their own labour in the form of sweat equity. However if you don&#8217;t have the necessary skills and connections yourself, you have to hire in talent and that isn&#8217;t going to be cheap. Good products take time and effort after all.</p>

<p>A competent freelancer will typically cost you around £8k per month—a good agency staffer doubly so. With these rates in mind, an early prototype taking two people a couple of months could cost in the region of £30-60k. For a fully fleshed out beta version, you&#8217;d probably want a team of three or four people working on it over a four to six month period. Plugging those figures in you&#8217;re looking at anything from £100-350k before you&#8217;ve even launched. Suddenly this starts to feel less like a cottage industry and more like a real business.</p>

<p>Having spoken to several successful investors, these figures seem to stack up. It would seem that most investors expect it to cost around £50k to get your proof of concept and around £250k to get that product to market.</p>

<p>In 1978, John Mackey borrowed $45k from the bank to set up a small, natural health store called SaferWay. Two years later they merged with Clarksville Natural Grocery to form Whole Food Market. At 12,500 square foot and a staff of 19, their first store was larger than most health food shops at the time. The place was beautifully designed, the staff were knowledgeable and the quality was exceptionally high. By 1984 they had expanded to Houston, Dallas and New Orleans and continued to grow throughout the eighties and ninties. At the end of 2009 they owned 302 stores in 3 countries and were considered by many as the best grocery store of it&#8217;s kind. </p>

<p>The story of John Mackey in not dissimilar to that of Thomas Marks. Both started small and both rose to the heady heights of success. The main differences is that what counted for small back in 1884 was very different to what counted for small in 1980. The competition was stronger and peoples expectations had changed.</p>

<p>I try to explain to potential entrepreneurs that the amount you invest needs to be in proportion with your expectations. If you want to make a living wage then the digital equivalent of a market stall is just fine. However if you want to set up a national or even global business, you need to maximise your chances of success and invest accordingly. Good start-ups don&#8217;t come cheap so you need to spend as much on your digital business as would on it&#8217;s physical equivalent. It&#8217;s as simple as that!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:3:{s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"andybudd";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"2011-02-05T14:42:43+00:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"

My talk was all about delivering exceptional customer service so it&#8217;s ironic that I received some of the worst customer service I&#8217;ve ever experienced at the hands of their UK team.</p>

<p>It all started when my bags got lost of the return journey. Loosing bags seems an unavoidable part of modern air travel and I&#8217;d had lost bags successfully returned in the past so wasn&#8217;t that worried. I simply logged the loss at Heathrow and two days later my bag was found and delivered to me. However upon receipt of the bag I noticed that it was lighter and decidedly less bulky that I remembered. Upon opening the bag I realised that several hundred pounds worth of stuff had been taken from my bag and I was livid. Either a direct employee of Iceland Air or somebody under their charge had stolen from me.</p>

<p>I emailed to complain but received what appeared to be a stock response saying that while they took the issue very seriously, they had a policy not to take responsibility for items stolen from customers, so there was nothing they could do about it. This response <span class="caps">REALLY </span>wound me up as I couldn&#8217;t see how they were taking the theft seriously by denying culpability and washing their hands of the issue.</p>

<p>I pressed the issue but was told that anybody could have stolen the items so there was no proof that Iceland Air were responsible. This threw fuel on the fire as I had entrusted my bags to Iceland Air and felt that they had a duty of care to look after my possessions. If they were going to subcontract part of their process to a third party, it was their responsibility to ensure that those companies were trustworthy and didn&#8217;t steal from their customers. If they did, Iceland Air should take responsibility for the theft rather that trying to pass blame, and then raise the issue of theft with their subcontractors.</p>

<p>Iceland Air were basically exposing the internal fallings of their organisation and using this as an excuse for impotency. Now I realise that baggage theft may be endemic in the travel industry so can understand why the airlines would prefer not to take responsibility. However if the airlines were to be held financially accountable for losses, I suspect that they would do a better job of vetting their partners and securing the processes. It also made me slightly scared for security reasons. If it&#8217;s that easy for ground staff to walk out of an airport with several hundreds of pounds worth of stolen goods, their background or security checks can&#8217;t be up to much.</p>

<p>I continued to press the matter and their UK representative begrudgingly sent me baggage loss and theft claim form. The fact that this form even existed basically negated their initial assertion that they took no responsibility for lost of stolen bags. Why would they have a stock claim form if it was their policy not to accept claims. This angered me even further as it appeared to be evidence that their initial email was a lie.</p>

<p>The form I was asked to fill in demanded receipts for all the items I was claiming for. Now as most people don&#8217;t keep receipts for every small item they buy, this could be seen as a thinly veiled attempt to avoid paying for older items. However as it happens the majority of items that were stolen were actually gifts that I&#8217;d bought while away. The only problem is, most of the receipts were in the stolen bag and Iceland Air refused to accept copies of my Visa statement as proof of purchase. Also a very hand get out clause.</p>

<p>Up to this point I wasn&#8217;t really concerned about the financial loss as I had travel insurance so would have been able to claim on that instead. It was a matter of principal and I wanted to give Iceland Air the opportunity to put matters right. From a customer service perspective you can tell how customer focused an organisation is, not by how they treat customers when things are going well, but by how they treat customers when things are going badly. So I had given Iceland Air&#8217;s customer services team an excellent opportunity to turn me into a lifelong advocate. However by shifting responsibility and passing the buck, they had done the exact opposite. In fact, rather than trying to serve their customer, I got the distinct impression that it was Iceland Air&#8217;s policy to insulate the company from their customers. </p>

<p>I suspect that a lot of companies make a decision how they are going to treat their customers based on their perceived worth. So for a company like Iceland Air, I would have to fly with them a bunch of times before they made back any compensation they would have given me for the stolen items. As such it probably makes pure economic sense for them refuse to pay for my stolen baggage and lose me as a customer. Sadly I think this is a mistake.</p>


<p>10 years ago when people weren&#8217;t as connected as they currently are today, there was marketing law which said that a happy customer would tell one of their friends while an unhappy customer would tell 10 of their friends. These days people have hundreds of friends on their Facebook accounts so I think this rule can be increased by a factor of 10. This means that customer service slips can no longer be hidden or insulated. These days unhappy customers will tell a thousand of their closest friends in an instant, and the fallout can be dramatic. As such I think it&#8217;s ever more important for companies like Iceland Air to hire great customer service representatives and ensure that they serve the needs to the customers and not just the needs of the business.</p>

<p>So how did this debacle with Iceland Air end up. Did they step up to the plate, admit responsibility and offer to compensate me for the stolen items? Sadly not. Frustrated by my dealings with Iceland Air I ended up contacting my insurance company instead. I was hopeful that Iceland Air would still come through, but as soon as they heard I&#8217;d contacted my insurers they were quick to pass the buck and close down my claim. They have also stopped answering my emails so have basically washed their hands of me.</p>

<p>With such poor treatment I&#8217;ve vowed never to fly with Iceland Air again. Sadly with a near monopoly on flights to Iceland, this means that it&#8217;s highly unlikely that I&#8217;ll return to Iceland again. It&#8217;s a shame as it&#8217;s a beautiful country with great people and we had an otherwise amazing time there. So it&#8217;s a shame the knock on affect poor customer service can have on people, especially when they are treated as problems rather than human beings.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:3:{s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"andybudd";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"2010-11-15T12:15:23+00:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"

<p>Back in the early days of the web you just had web designers. These multi-disciplined individuals would design the pages, code up the table based layouts, set up the database and program the <span class="caps">CMS.</span> They were able to do all these jobs because the field of knowledge back then was fairly limited and hence the outputs were fairly basic. You could also argue that websites were basic precisely because they were designed and built by a single person, but that&#8217;s probably for another article.</p>

<p>As the field of knowledge grew and sites got bigger and more complex, distinct roles started to emerge. First the roles split into designer and developer. Then as sites demanded more off their back-ends you&#8217;d have database architects, systems administrators, systems architects and a whole slew of sub roles. Similarly on the front end you would find people who specialised in interface design, front end development, motion design and, more recently, user experience design.</p>

<p>Now user experience design is an interesting one as it&#8217;s both a series of activities (research, information architecture, interaction design etc.) as well as a job title in it&#8217;s own right. For smaller projects it&#8217;s perfectly feasible for a single person to plan the architecture, sketch the wireframes, design the interface and even code up the pages; just in the same way that it would be perfectly feasible for a single builder to plan and build an extension to your house. However as a project becomes more complicated you need more people with deeper expertise. So just as large building projects require quantity surveyors, draftsmen, architects, interior designers, wayfinding designers and a whole host of other experts, so do websites.</p>

<p>I think the reason Ryan thinks that &#8220;&#8216;UX professional&#8217; is a bullshit job title&#8221; designed to &#8220;over-charge naive clients&#8221; is because he&#8217;s never actually been in the position to need one. If you look at Ryans&#8217; background, he worked for agencies in the late nineties and early noughties when the field of user experience was still in it&#8217;s infancy. As such I suspect that he&#8217;s never worked with a team of dedicated UX people.</p>

<p>In more recent years Ryan has become a conference organiser and content publisher, producing relatively straightforward websites which really don&#8217;t need a dedicated UX person. He&#8217;s also dabbled as a start-up entrepreneur, although sadly none have been a huge commercial success as of yet. In fact, Ryan is very much embedded in the bootstrapped start-up culture where all you need is a smart designer and developer to see your ideas come to life. So in early stage start-ups where you&#8217;re designing for people like yourselves, you can definitely get away without a dedicated UX person if you&#8217;ve got a talented team with enough overlap. However once the project grows, you&#8217;ll probably benefit from the help of a dedicated UX professional.</p>

<p>10 years ago I thought much the same way as Ryan. I couldn&#8217;t understand how companies could spend millions on a website when a designer and developer could knock something together in a weekend. Similarly why would anybody need a pretentious title like Information Architect when I&#8217;m perfectly capable of putting together the site map for the brochureware site I was working on myself?</p>

<p>Of course I quickly learned how naive I was being. There&#8217;s a huge difference between knocking together the site-map for a piece of brochureware and developing a complete ontology, taxonomy and controlled vocabulary for a site with hundreds of thousands of data-points. Similarly there a big difference spending a couple of days working out wireframes in balsamiq for that shopify project you&#8217;re working on and spending months prototyping and testing a complex application with hundreds of interactions.</p>

<p>Sadly I do think Ryan has accidentally hit on something here, and it&#8217;s a trend I&#8217;m seeing more and more of; web designers with an interest in user experience re-branding themselves as UX professionals. So there are an increasing number of people out there who are calling themselves UX designers because they&#8217;ve sketched out some wireframes and sat in on a couple of usability tests.</p>

<p>By contrast a typical UX person will have a much deeper understanding of cognitive psychology, human computer interaction and design research than their graphically focused colleagues. They will have more experience running stake-holder interviews, usability evaluations and ethnographic studies. They will be more versed in the creation of personas, concept models, scenarios, user-flows and storyboards. They will be able to create  wireframes and experience prototypes using a wide range of tools and to differing levels of fidelity depending on the questions being asked and the intended audience. In fact there are a whole host of skills that differentiate a UX designer from a more general web designer. So if this sounds like you why don&#8217;t you check out our <a href="http://clearleft.com/is/hiring/">job for a user experience designer at Clearleft</a></p>

<p>As far as Ryan is concerned, I suspect he isn&#8217;t as naive as he sounds. After all, he&#8217;s been in the industry for a long time and even ran an online UX conference a few months back which Clearleft spoke at. So I can&#8217;t believe Ryan would put something on he didn&#8217;t believe in just for the money. If he did, that would show a real contempt for his customers. Instead I suspect it&#8217;s just a way to stir up controversy and drive traffic to his site. However if Ryan really believes there&#8217;s no difference between a web designer and a user experience designer I&#8217;m sure we can supply him a big list of books to read and conferences to attend in order to change his mind.</p>

<p>So I suggest that the UX community bear in mind where Ryan&#8217;s coming from and realise that for some people UX is just a quality attribute or set of activities. After all, not everybody on the web is building the kind of large scale projects that benefit from a dedicated UX resource. Sometimes a UX savvy web designer is just enough. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:3:{s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"User Experience";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"andybudd";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"2010-09-05T18:50:40+00:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"

Large media business have effectively lobbied government under the spurious claim that without protection the future of the digital economy in the UK is at threat. However the future of digital isn&#8217;t locked inside a few big content companies distributing their goods electronically. The future of the digital economy is in empowering a creative class to produce new and as yet unheard of business opportunities on the web. So rather than protecting the digital economy, the Digital Economy Act will have the effect of protecting outdated business models and harming innovation in the UK and handing over initiative to more liberal and less restrictive countries.</p>

<p>One potentially damaging aspect facing UK start-ups and freelancers is the one makes the owners of open wifi networks responsible for the traffic that passes over the network. This three strikes and your out process that requires no proof and provides no real means of defence will have a damming effect on the coffee shop culture in the <span class="caps">UK.</span> Bars, cafes, public libraries and any other wifi provider will now be responsible for the traffic on their network. As such, many will stop providing open access for fear of disconnection, and the cafe working culture so important to the start-up community is at risk of coming to a crashing end.</p>

<p>Considering it&#8217;s taken so long to foster this culture, I think it&#8217;s going to be a huge loss to the digital economy and a terrible shame.

Yesterday I received a contrite email from this person saying that the incident had ruined their life and asking if I&#8217;d remove the post. It turns out that my blog post ranked in the top 20 results for this guys name and he was wondering if I&#8217;d remove the article. I considered it, as to be honest I&#8217;d completely forgotten about the event (as had most people 2 weeks after it happen) and I didn&#8217;t really care that much anyway. However it got me thinking about two different things. </p>

<p>On the one hand, the Internet can freeze youthful folly and a small transgressions can stick with you for life. So that picture of you drunk and passed out in a skip, or that heated argument you had on a mailing list when you were twenty can come back and haunt you. This is something that the Facebook generation is beginning to discover as they enter the job market only to have their potential boss Google their antics. Surely everybody deserves the anonymity of youth; to screw up a few times and not have it haunt you for life for ever. I&#8217;m a pretty decent chap and felt sorry for the guy, so was definitely tempted to strike his transgressions from the history books. I know that I&#8217;d want somebody to show me some compassion if the position was reversed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, by removing this information aren&#8217;t we effectively rewriting history? I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all written dumb things on the Internet in the past, yet we don&#8217;t all go around asking for this information to be doctored. Shouldn&#8217;t people be forced to standby their mistakes and carry them with honour and dignity? Isn&#8217;t it important to know that the MP now campaigning for family values once smoked pot and screwed around? Similarly isn&#8217;t it useful to know that somebody who now makes their living writing standards based code once said&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Standards cronies have now latched on to the disabled &#8216;the starving African children of high technology&#8217; for leverage. Spend time reading A List Apart, and you&#8217;ll soon get the impression that accessibility is bigger than cancer, and we&#8217;re all about to go blind and lose our mouse-bearing limbs. The solution? Web standards!&#8221;</blockquote>

I asked about the moral implications of this and was surprised by the response. While the audience largely disagreed with the idea of speculative design work, it seemed that speculative UX work was somehow more acceptable. The speaker later cc&#8217;d me into an email question from one of the audience members querying  my negative reaction to speculative pitching so here was my response&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Dear <span class="caps">XXXX,</span>

<p>There has been a debate over the subject of speculative work running within the design community for some time now, so I thought it was worth raising the issue.</p>

<p>One side of the argument states that helping a client solve their problems for free, before being awarded a contact is bad practice. This camp feels that speculative work of any kind devalues the work that we do by the very fact that we&#8217;re giving it away at no cost. This helps solidify the notion that thinking about a problem is free and that designers should only get paid for production work. However many designers feel that it is in-fact their problems solving abilities that give them their competitive edge and that the production work is just a by-product of this. The fear is that if designers continue to do work for free, this may become expected practice, as it is in other creative industries. This puts the power squarely in the hands of the client, forcing all designer to capitulate and therefor suffer large amounts of outlay in order to secure relatively modest contracts.</p>

<p>The other side of the argument states that designers should do whatever they need in order to win a project and that speculative work is a legitimate means of business development. Many of them will count this as part of their new business development spend and will have already accounted for this in their rates. These designers cite that speculative work is already expected in other fields like advertising so is becoming the norm. They will also argue that speculative work is no different from other sales activities like meetings, proposal writing etc.</p>

<p>Personally I feel that this argument is rather reductive. Just because speculative work exists in other industries doesn&#8217;t mean that it has a place on the web. With large advertising agencies the contracts can be worth millions of pounds. With these kind of figures at stake it seems worth spending a couple of weeks on a pitch. However very little web work comes close to these figures, so the amount of speculative work needed  is disproportionately high.</p>

<p>While it is true that speculative work can help you win projects in the short term, once it becomes the norm it places a large burden on the industry in general. Due to the cost of speculative work and its early place in the buying cycle, it is rare that you will have enough information to do a sufficiently processional job. As such, not only do you wean  clients into the idea that the work you do has little value, but that the resulting quality is low.</p>

As with other industries, there is an inherent &#8216;cost to sale.&#8217; As such lots of free work does go on. My argument is that this work should involve explaining to your customers how you will go about solving their problems and how you have used similar techniques to solve the problems of other clients. I do not believe that helping to solve clients problems in advance of winning the project is a long term sustainable business practice. Furthermore, by devaluing the work that we do, I feel that speculative problem-solving can damage the industry as a whole.&#8221;</blockquote>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:3:{s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"andybudd";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"2010-02-11T09:22:51+00:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"

It would be held on a yet-to-be-determined Saturday at the <a href="http://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> offices in Brighton and would focus on practical, hands-on tuition.</p>

<p>We would start with how to plan, research and design a talk that delights your audience, paying special attention to story telling and narrative. We would then move onto the delivery and performance side of things; teaching people how to project their voice, vary their tone, use the stage and work the audience. It&#8217;s all basic stuff, but it&#8217;s these rookie errors that can damage an otherwise excellent presentation.</p>

<p>To ensure everybody gets the individual attention they need, the even will be for a limited number of people. I&#8217;m not sure how many yet, but probably no more than 12. Everybody will be expected to present a short practice talk and we&#8217;ll video each session so the attendees see how they improve over the day. So they&#8217;ll be no tourists. </p>

<p>This  workshop will be aimed at people who are really keen on breaking into the conference speaking circuit and need some coaching and improvement. So it&#8217;s not for folks who want to brush up on their general speaking skills.</p>

In the age of the Mad Men, selling a new product was easy. You&#8217;d be handed a commodity product like toothpaste or washing powder and set about building a brand to set it apart from the competition. You would then buy advertising space on a small number of influential marketing channels and wait for the sales to roll in. The growth of multi-channel <span class="caps">TV, </span>the commercialisation of radio and the rise of desktop publishing in the 80s fragmented audiences, making it hard to get the message out. However it was the appearance of the Internet that changed marketing for ever.</p>

<p>Attention splintered across thousands of channels and billions of website as web-savvy shoppers began to compare products online and shop in the long tail.  In a world where company owners no longer had control over the way their products were presented, power went back to the consumer. </p>

<p>At present only the Super Bowl advertising resembles the marketing to the old days (the ability to get in front of an enormous audience at once) and marketers have been looking to employ alternative tactics to push users towards their sites.  As a result, a plethora of companies have begun viewing the web as a new marketing platform and introduced &#8220;viral campaigns&#8221; and &#8220;sticky content&#8221; to generate traffic. </p>

<p>The question is, will the spike in traffic generated by push tactics help generate extra sales? Push marketing gimmicks work for a while - just as a free toy inside every cereal used to - but these concepts eventually lose their polish. In this world of decreasing timescales, even social media marketing has become so 2007. Instead of being a marketing platform, the web has become a product and service platform in its own right. </p>

<p>To sell products in a networked world, you need to differentiate yourself by more than just brand attributes and a check-list of features. You need to create remarkable products that rise above the competition and get noticed. Products that your users will rate, recommend and tweet about. In fact, what you need to create isn&#8217;t a product at all, but an experience.</p>

<p>Hoteliers have known this for a long time, moving up the value chain and transforming themselves from places to sleep into memorable holiday experiences. Gone are the chocolates on the pillow to be replaced by Egyptian cotton sheets, high end toiletries and HD televisions in every room. In fact hotels have a name for these items; they call them ‘delighters’.</p>

<p>Mediocrity just doesn&#8217;t cut it anymore. Instead, we need to create products that sell themselves. Does this mean that marketing no longer has a place in the networked society? Far from it. Marketers often understand customer needs and pain points better than anybody. In fact, this can sometimes be the cause of frustration in itself. I know plenty of people (myself included) who&#8217;ve been wooed by the notion of integrated phone, TV and Internet services only to find yourself dealing with completely separate business units and billing systems. The marketers were ahead of the curve. It&#8217;s the product that was lagging behind.</p>

<p>Companies like Zappos understand the power of delight only too well. Things like complimentary overnight shipping and personalised notes are just the tip of the iceberg for this online shoe retailer from Las Vegas. Zappos have done away with the call-waiting lights and encourage their staff to bond with their customers. They even train their staff to order out-of-stock shoes for their customers on competitor’s sites. The competitors get the sale but Zappos gets the goodwill. I even heard tell of one of their call centre staff helping a clients to order pizza, although this is apocryphal. No wonder they recently got acquired by Amazon for US$1.2 billion.<br />
Marketers have a massive role in shaping new products. They also have an enormous role in shaping people’s opinions on a more personal level. You could even say that customer service is the new marketing. New online services like Get Satisfaction are hoping this will be the case and companies like Zappos would seem to agree. </p>

<p>The secret sauce is simple. We need to take a more customer centred approach to creating products that solve real problems for real people. We need to listen to our customer’s wants, needs and frustrations and create products that solve them. We need to constantly strive to improve our products at their core, rather than hiding their inadequacies with slick marketing campaigns. We need to create experiences that consumers can rally around and talk about, and we need to get out there and engage with the conversation. Not everybody can or will be able to create remarkable products, but the ones that do will flourish and prosper. </p>

<p>So what does this mean for the future of push marketing? I think that it is increasingly becoming clear that the effectiveness of viral campaigns will inevitably dwindle, while clients will begin to question whether their &#8220;sticky content&#8221; is not just brining them traffic, but the right kind of traffic. </p>

<p>Concepts such as “sticky content” belie the core concepts that are required underneath. Clients are going to need to spend more time learning the needs, wants and desires of their customers when building products, applications and campaigns so that they are pushing the right kind of traffic.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if you spend time creating something that people want, they will do the job of marketing it for you</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:3:{s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"User Experience";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"andybudd";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"2010-01-27T09:18:52+00:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"

This would be fine if you worked in a mature industry or one with a limited number of books, papers and conferences appearing each year. However in the knowledge economy of the web, more information is being published every day than could be consumed in a year. What&#8217;s more, that pace is increasing. </p>

<p>The problem is exacerbated by a number of things. First of all I&#8217;m a reasonably prolific speaker, so feel the need to spend time researching my next topic and synthesising the results. I also program two conferences so have to spend a certain amount of time researching potential speakers and reviewing their slides or presentation videos. Oh, and on top of that I&#8217;ve got a company to run, clients to satisfy and staff to look after. As such the majority of this research happens at evenings and weekends, outside office hours.</p>

<p>As such, I often find myself in a position of triage; making snap judgements about the value of information I find and then prioritising them accordingly. So I clip articles to <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, store audio in <a href="http://huffduffer.com/andybudd">Huffduffer</a> and podcasts in iTunes. I subscribe to <span class="caps">RSS </span>feeds, capture video presentations on <a href="http://www.popscreen.com/andybudd">PopScreen</a> and store lists of books to read on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fgp%2Fregistry%2Fwishlist%2F10FMOL6NNBZNB&amp;tag=blogography-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450">Amazon</a>. Oh, and I&#8217;ve got a stack of presentations to review on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/andybudd/favorites">SlideShare</a> at some stage. Every now and then I get chance to chip away at some of these data sources, but it&#8217;s rarely enough. Here&#8217;s a quick example of what I&#8217;m currently dealing with&#8230;</p>


<ul>
<li>269 video presentations to watch</li>
<li>230 slide decks to review</li>
<li>36 books to read</li>
<li>542 unread <span class="caps">RSS </span>feed posts</li>
<li>141 podcast episodes to listen to</li>
<li>213 unread articles</li>
</ul>



<p>It&#8217;s a classic case of <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/information-anxiety.html">Information Anxiety</a>. Not enough free time to process all the information I want to. The result is a constant background level of stress. Even when I&#8217;m at rest I&#8217;m thinking about all the stuff I should, and could, be doing. Now I&#8217;ve always been a fairly relaxed person so am comfortable dealing with the stress. But it&#8217;s ever-present all the same.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about going on a holiday recently. Now with most holidays the point is to go away, relax and re-charge your batteries. However I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of a different, and thoroughly 21st century holiday. Not to relax but to consume. The idea would be to go somewhere for a week or ten days with a stack load of book, articles, presentations and podcasts and get on top of my information overload. I&#8217;m not sure if this kind of working vacation common but I know at least a couple of friends who have dome this in the last few months. </p>

<p>Holidays at home are popular at the moment, so it&#8217;s something I considered. However I felt that the familiar scenery would force me into learnt patterns of behaviour that would prevent me from getting stuff done. Instead I&#8217;m looking for somewhere quiet—but not isolated—where I can spend the day snacking on information. It could be a cottage in the country or a hut on the beach. Just as long as the surroundings have enough variety to keep me interested and prevent me from getting cabin fever.  So if you&#8217;ve got any ideas, give me a shout.</p>

<p>In the meantime, do you have trouble keep on-top of the wealth of information thrown at you? Have you developed interesting or useful coping strategies? Would love to hear from you.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:3:{s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Misc";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"andybudd";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"2010-01-23T21:47:25+00:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"
