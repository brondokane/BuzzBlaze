Or to the professional project pool where we wait on that client who will allow us the freedom to incorporate this idea into their project. At other times, the ideas we have tend to be in response to the client, their business or something they have laid down — some sort of foundation — for us to build upon. These ideas are somewhat prompted.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36417205@N08/5112547263/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/aces.jpg" alt="Aces in Why Wait For The Opportunity?

Image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36417205@N08/5112547263//">fitzsean</a></em></caption><p>Now this is not to say that the prompted ideas are any less potent or powerful than the ones that we arrived at alone, only that the ones we get to by ourselves tend to be more imaginative and exciting in our eyes as those are the ones we feel unencumbered by the clients rules or specs. Which also means that they are the ones that we get to work less on due to the fact that we have to pay the bills, and in most cases, that means some kind of compromise on the part of the creative mind. We can say that <strong>we think outside the box on every project</strong>, but we have to admit that when a client comes to us, they have one or two ideas in the bucket ready and those specs can be considered somewhat of a box that we <em>must </em>work in.</p><h3>That Is Just How Business Works</h3><p>Now I know that there are some who are scratching their heads, knowing that this is just the way how business works, and they are confused at to what exactly we are asking them to consider. And yes, we understand that this is the standard way by which this game is played. Businesses have needs &mdash; they turn to other experts or specialists to have these needs met. They explain exactly what it is they are looking for, and the experts comply, delivering the experience that hopefully surpasses the client&#8217;s expectations. But <strong>what if we could change the standard rules</strong> of gameplay here on a much wider scale, affording this much freer approach to any designer or developer who wished to truly work unhindered.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35983665@N08/4216314732/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/think-outisde-the-box2.jpg" alt="Think-outisde-the-box2 in Why Wait For The Opportunity?

Image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35983665@N08/4216314732/">west.m</a></em></caption><p>Just a quick note: this article is not trying to say that working with <em>all </em>clients is a dull, innovation adjacent venture, or even trying to say that you will never have to work under these more standard rules of gameplay. But we usually have ideas of our own — ideas that we would love to see through <strong>without having to compromise or consult</strong> with a client or anyone else for that matter to approve what we are doing.</p><p>Think of it like the difference in a movie director working independently on a film rather than working for a major studio. They have much more freedom to make the film as they see fit, without any interference from above. For a while this was an approach that not many designers or developers have thought to not be feasible, but that is all changing.</p><p>Thanks, by and large, to the avenues being created by and granted access to by the Web.</p><h3>The Game Changer</h3><p>Before now, and in some ways still, we have always had to take our ideas to someone else in order to help us make them happen. We had to reach beyond ourselves to find those with the means and know-hows to reach further than we had access in order to get our idea out to the masses and have it connect with the audience. Essentially, we had to sell our idea to someone else in order to get distribution and manufacturing. However, the Web is granting creatives the chances to write their own opportunities, and <strong>make things happen</strong> for themselves, without having to depend on someone else.</p><p>Understanding that the term &#8220;sellout&#8221; tends to carry negative connotations, but what I mean is that we have to pitch the idea and someone has to buy in order for it to happen. When they buy, that tends to put them in the controlling seat. They hold the final say over the outcome of the project, or even where the project ends up. For some creatives, that compromise alone can take a lot of the fun and excitement out of the equation. But without those buyers, the project would tend to remain an unrealized effort. So there has been an underlying coercion for creatives to <strong>play the game and compromise their ideas</strong> when necessary in order to connect with the masses.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49879584@N00/4323862715/in/photostream/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/strategic-game.jpg"/ width="450" height="450" alt="Strategic-game in Why Wait For The Opportunity?

Image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49879584@N00/4323862715/in/photostream/">DoubleM2</a></em></caption><p>Enter the Web, and services like <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, communities like YouTube and Vimeo, and suddenly the middle men that we needed to make our innovative ideas a reality, are not as much of a necessity as they once were. There is a great article by <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/design/the-game-just-completely-changed/">Ryan Carson</a> that highlighted two examples of just <em>how</em> those in creative fields who are no longer waiting for opportunity to knock, instead create those opportunities for themselves. And in these cases, what remains important is that they remain the ones calling the shots.</p><p>Now I know there are those who think that this is approach is a complete waste of time. However, already today there are creatives who are just as equally excited about this evolved approach which allows them to completely <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/30453381/the-shape-of-design">take the reigns of their creative projects</a>. So below we have taken a look at both the benefits offered and challenges posed by this new gameplay structure to help better see what exactly this approach means and entails.</p><h3>The Benefits</h3><p>First, we are going to <strong>look at the pros to taking charge of our creations </strong>and marching forward with them on our own as the masters of our own destiny. If you are one of those who is on the fence about this whole issue, or even if you are standing firmly against it, perhaps this section will have you rethinking things and getting you to come down on the side for it.</p><h4>Shot-Caller</h4><p>This has already been mentioned in the article; however, given its weight, it deserves a deeper examination of just what makes it so important. For most of us in the design and development fields, we have had to work with a client whose lack of understanding of the field can negatively impact the resulting project once their uncompromising input has been implemented. This can hugely effect our resulting takeaway and perspective with which we begin to view our chosen fields. Especially, if we find project after project that comes with compromise after compromise. This can effectively end up sapping our excitement and stifling our creative energy.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32066106@N06/4789352849/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Defining-targets-differently.jpg" alt="Defining-targets-differently in Why Wait For The Opportunity? Create Your Own!" width="500" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88376" /></a><br /><caption><em>You&#8217;re your own boss and choose your own target. Image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32066106@N06/4789352849/">HikingArtist.com</a></em></caption><p>Another side effect these compromises can have is that we end up having to lose some truly innovative element of the project because of the client&#8217;s wishes, and our work can somewhat reflect a staleness on our parts as a result. When users see the final design and interact with it, they only see the compromised end result. They <strong>do not see the processes or the decisions and conditions</strong> that ultimately led to a creation that could essentially be much less than its potential. And it is this end result that is looked upon as the limits of our abilities. Client&#8217;s input is useful and necessary, but sometimes it&#8217;s not exactly what is best for our users. And yes, design is not art, but a medium for delivering messages across, but as designers we are often quite restricted by the decisions made for us, not with us.</p><p>But when we are the one who is calling all of the shots, our creative energy can flow freely, and our imaginations are subject to no one&#8217;s approval or standards. And there are those who would say that using a service like Kickstarter, where you outline a project and potential investors commit to contributions to fund your creative venture, does not put you in the driver&#8217;s seat per se, as you are still having to &#8220;sell&#8221; your idea. However, the big difference is that the sponsors and investors you get via Kickstarter do not expect to be able to provide some kind of creative input. You are the one in control.</p><p>This also means that <strong>you are the one in control of the timeline</strong> for when and if the project sees the light of day. This can be key, as there are times in the design and development fields when those elements are out of our hands and they end up derailing the project far from its potential or intended destinations. There are times when we work <em>so</em> hard on a project and have put <em>so</em> much into it until we have molded it to what we feel is perfection, only to turn it over and have it altered or never see the light of day. Consequently, there are times when we feel (for whatever reason) that a project just will not come together and should be abandoned, but we can&#8217;t drop it, so the end result is a sub-par product that nobody is actually happy with. In this field of play, those calls are all ours.</p><p><strong>In Short:</strong></p><ul><li>You have to deal with less compromises that sap your enthusiasm and excitement for both the project and your field.</li><li>Your reputation does not suffer from compromises the client forced us to make.</li><li>You do not have to worry about outside interference, our imagination is not subject to approval.</li><li>Your project outcome is completely in your hands, and <em>your</em> hands alone.</li></ul><h4>Time and Money Saver</h4><p>It may seem like somewhat of a contradiction that this approach could actually save time and money, but when you look at the first example of designer <a href="http://work.frankchimero.com/">Frank Chimero</a> and his design book that he now can completely finance via Kickstarter, you can see how this approach can do just that. More often than not, in order to get a book published and distributed within what is commonly seen as the mainstream, you would first have to spend weeks, possibly months, writing and rewriting both the outline for the book and the book proposal &#40;not to mention the numerous e-mails, phone calls and meetings with possible publishers&#41;. All of which is done without any guarantee of being published and distributed.</p><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/30453381/the-shape-of-design"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/kickstarter.jpg" width="500" height="340" alt="Kickstarter in Why Wait For The Opportunity?

And in some cases, the entire book or some parts of it must first be written before we are able to get any interest from publishers or distributors. So that time has to be accounted for as well. But <strong>by harnessing the Web and social media</strong>, we can now find the means to publish and distribute the book on our own &mdash; without consuming much time and often the costly process of seeking out and involving the proverbial middle men in the project. For instance, Smashing Magazine <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=smashing-book-2">produces printed books independently</a>, without the middle man, and so can you.</p><p>This is a big step forward, and helps to connect the potential investors directly to the creative individuals, without the compromised hands of the mainstream middle men getting into the project, which simply feels more conducive to innovation. Compromised decisions can end up hurting the project&#8217;s potential. This can also mean that we will end up with less forced input which can lead to time consuming revision after time consuming revision which could end up compromising the overall impact of the message. Which might further translate into lost sales. Therefore, we can see <em>huge</em> savings in both time and costs by opting for this new paradigm.</p><p><strong>In Short:</strong></p><ul><li>We can save a lot of time, which tends to equal money, in both the initial and final project stages via this route.</li><li>Taps potential investors directly into the source of ideas, without any agendas or middle men getting in the way.</li></ul><h4>Smoother Sailing in the Client Pool</h4><p>Now, one possible benefit that we could see spring forth from this approach is the higher chances of landing dream clients. This may seem a bit far fetched, but if there were more designers and developers writing their own opportunities and launching their own projects then that is going to create interest in the client pool, right? Essentially, going the route, you can effectively choose between working on a client&#8217;s project or creating your own which you could put in your portfolio or even gain some exposure with and consequently connect with some potential clients.</p><p>Besides, since you are engaging your heart and soul into your project, you are more likely to produce a remarkable product — a product that will help you gain new insights, learn new creative fields and leave a mark in the design community. You can also create a well-respected name for yourself. And it&#8217;s certainly worth trying.</p><h4>Profit-Sharing</h4><p>One of the biggest problems that anyone working in any creative field faces, is <strong>the undervaluing of their time and talents</strong>. This can come either in the guise of those who simply do not see the value of what we do, or in the form of those who capitalize on our creativity without having contributed to the creative process in any way. Whatever form it may take, it means that someone is profiting off of <em>your</em> creativity.</p><p>Now, there are cases when there is a service attached to it that we could not handle ourselves. Back in the day, distribution was one of the main incentives that creative persons had to aligning themselves with this model in which they create the product, and do not get to see the majority of the profits from the project. Designers and developers have been signing on with company that provided them with the space and tools they need to do the work for years because of the sheer cost it saves them. Only to sacrifice shares of the profits from their work, not to mention the ability to do the work that they necessarily want the way they want it. But again, this is not the only paradigm on the market anymore.</p><p>You want to organize a design conference and sell tickets for it? <a href="http://www.amiando.com/">There</a> <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">are</a> <a href="http://www.eventwax.com/">services</a> for you.

You don&#8217;t have to rely on anybody, but instead you can just put together everything you need and leverage the potential of social media to back up your projects.</p><p><a href="http://www.natashawescoat.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/natasha.jpg" width="500" height="310" alt="Natasha in Why Wait For The Opportunity? Create Your Own!"  /></a><br /><em><a href="http://www.natashawescoat.com/">Natasha Westcoat</a> creates live online paintings. She saves herself the percentages that galleries, art dealers and online intermediaries, might charge if she sold the work through them.</em></p><p>With no middle men to have to share the profits with, this new approach can also allow us to get the bulk of the revenues generated from the projects that we have created. In the example provided in Ryan&#8217;s article, <a href="http://www.natashawescoat.com/">Natasha Westcoat</a>&#8217;s live online paintings, not only does she save herself the time and effort of seeking a gallery show to find buyers, she saves herself the percentages that galleries, art dealers and online intermediaries, might charge if she sold the work through them. Here, she controls the profits. So it is exciting to see that the old profit share piggyback model is not the only path in which designers and developers find themselves in these days given the reach and access afforded to them by the Web.</p><p><strong>In Short:</strong></p><ul><li>With this new model, the person who is generating and creating the idea is the one who will reap the majority of the rewards from their work, as it should be.</li><li>No longer do we have to share the majority of our profits with those who offer us services that help spread the word &mdash; not create it.</li><li>With the middle men gone, the revenues can be more evenly and fairly distributed.</li></ul><h3>The Challenges</h3><p>Anyone who is seriously considering taking on the &#8220;independent&#8221; route, needs to understand that there might be some challenges in the road ahead. These are serious considerations that should be made before moving forward.</p><h4>Weight of the World</h4><p>Most of the time that we take on a project, there are going to be some elements of that cause us some bit of stress. Be it the timeline, those we are working with or compromises made. But we tend to be somewhat compartmentalized in the project and therefore our stress levels tend to be as well. If there is stress involved in the project, we can bet that we are only experiencing a fraction of that stress through the buffers provided by the numerous rungs in the ladder above us. Also, because we are usually stacked somewhere in a hierarchy, the instigators of the stress are somewhat abstracts to us. For example, if we are working with a big company, we tend to not have to interact with the client or public directly, it is done through a series of intermediaries. So when they are upset, we get hints of that, but not necessarily the brunt of it.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64519085@N00/4439325687/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/A-pints-a-pound-the-world-around.jpg" alt="A-pints-a-pound-the-world-around in Why Wait For The Opportunity? Create Your Own!" width="450" height="450" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88378" /></a><br /><caption><em>No matter where, the burden is the same. Image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sporkwrapper/250163954/">Kristian Bjornard</a></em></caption><p>This is not the case when we are stepping up as the masters of our projects. We have no buffers or barriers which allow us to compartmentalize any of it. We are baring the full weight of this world on our shoulders, and are not shielded from the reactions of the public. It all rests on us. Every cog in the process, from creation to marketing, from production to distribution is our responsibility. Either we have to handle it ourselves, or we have to find the right people to put into those roles to ensure that it all goes smoothly and according to plan. If it doesn&#8217;t, the blame will fall on you and your reputation &mdash; no one else&#8217;s. Also, we need to makke certain decisions that we don&#8217;t necessarily know much about: e.g. if you decide to print a book, what about fulfillment and support?</p><p>This can admittedly be a terrifying step to take, especially when you have never worked through all aspects of the project process before. If you are not strong in marketing, or have never actually overseen the production step by step, doing these tasks for the first time can seem overwhelming. And it is easy to see why many would rather play it safer instead of working on a more demanding and involved approach. For many of us, no benefit is enough to willingly accept the entire weight of the project on our shoulders.</p><p><strong>In Short:</strong></p><ul><li>If you pick the &#8220;independent&#8221; route, you are responsible for everything, and you alone will own each of the project&#8217;s successes and failures.</li><li>No matter where your strengths are lacking, you have to find ways to fill those gaps and pick up that slack to ensure the project succeeds.</li><li>You have no buffers to the reactions and fallouts from the project &mdash; you have to deal with it all directly.</li></ul><h4>Confidence Factor</h4><p>Another consideration that must be understood is that you are not selling the idea alone, you are also promoting yourself. Which is where confidence comes into play pretty heavily. It is easy to have faith in an idea and be able to get others to sign on and ascribe to that idea through the confidence that you are reflecting in it. However, when you are the head of the pyramid, it is not just faith in the idea that all parties involved need, everybody needs to have faith in the main person behind it.</p><p>That faith in oneself is harder to project with enough confidence to necessarily have others clamoring at your heels wanting to throw in on the proverbial backing bandwagon. And given that many of us might not be used to having to promote ourselves and effectively market ourselves in order to make a project happen, this could be a necessary adjustment. It is one thing to effectively market ourselves into a job, where we are pitted against other individuals, but in this case, we are marketing ourselves against an entire, well, market. It is not just about the idea, but about <strong>our ability to make it real</strong>. Whereas now we are competing with what can be seen as more financially stable companies, not just the ideas they are pitching.</p><p>As part of a company, when we go forth with an idea, there is a reputation behind us, more than just our own. When we do it alone — not so much. So once again it is easy to understand how this could act as a deterrent. On the other side, it might as well be an area that not deters you, but vividly alerts you to something that you are going to need to work on before you move ahead.</p><p><strong>In Short:</strong></p><ul><li>It is not just the idea under scrutiny, but your ability to make it happen as well.</li><li>You must be able to effectively position and market yourself and your project against the rest of the market.</li><li>You do not have any other reputation backing the project other than your own.</li></ul><h4>No End in Sight</h4><p>Finally, you must consider that if you are going to try and create your own opportunities and run with them, you will be running for a long, long time. When you are the one spearheading the entire project, and overseeing all facets of the process, there is no end of the line where you just get to hand it over and then move on to the next project. You <strong>have to stick with this project and ride it out</strong> for the entire reach and life of the project. No matter where it leads, you have signed on to following, and that could prove to be a very long haul indeed. Somewhere, that road could potentially keep going, always requiring some level of dedication, if not participation, on your part.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/netogonzalez/4476962563/in/photostream/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Can-you-picture-wht-will-be-the-end.jpg" alt="Can-you-picture-wht-will-be-the-end in Why Wait For The Opportunity? Create Your Own!" width="" height="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88379" /></a><br /><caption><em>Can you picture the end? Image by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/netogonzalez/4476962563/in/photostream/">N3T1O</a></em></caption><p>This could effectively undo any of the time saved benefit that got you looking favorably at this idea in the first place. So you have to look reasonably at the long term time investments and consider how much time the project could require to completely <strong>determine if the project will be worthwhile to pursue</strong>. Keep in mind that the project will eventually endure beyond their initial projected commitments, althought the exact details depend on the project itself. And it would be better to realize this before beginning and getting others to commit, so that the project does not fall short of its potential because you actually underestimated your own project.</p><p><strong>In Short:</strong></p><ul><li>You may have to be willing to commit to it for however long the project survives to maintain its integrity.</li><li>There is no point at which you should be expecting to be able to just cut and run from the project without seeing it through to the absolute end.</li></ul><h3>In the End</h3><p>Doing things on your own is risky but worthwhile. There is certainly some merit to creating your own opportunities. The tools are available; the medium for connecting with friends, colleagues and like-minded people is available; and you can freely explore your creativity and skills using both of them. I honestly believe that this new culture we observe today might change the rules of the game and I anxiously wait to see what interesting new developments spring up as a result.

The user experience (UX) designers who work at agile start-ups are required to do two things exceptionally well: (1) grasp the <strong>intent</strong> of the product or service being developed, and (2) effectively communicate those good intentions to end users in a language they’ll understand. Neither of these is as straightforward as it might sound.</p><p>Ideally, designers will jumpstart their design process by carefully selecting well-reasoned entrepreneurs to work with; but what happens when the designer is altogether alien to the community he is designing for? The breakneck speed of agile start-ups makes it incredibly <strong>difficult for designers to craft appropriate messages</strong> to their audience at large. Only by understanding the processes and opinions that dominate start-ups can designers begin to reach out and make a difference for the end users of their product or service.</p><h3>User-Centered Design, Sans User</h3><p>Designing with a clear idea of who the users are has <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/the-user-centered-design-conundrum/">never been simple</a>. Most designers who have experience with the trial by fire known as a “<a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/lean-startups-and-user-experience-design/">lean start-up</a>” will almost vehemently agree: because there are more than a few fires to fight, adopting a <a href="http://www.uxmag.com/design/shades-of-grey-thoughts-on-sketching" rel="nofollow">big-d Design process</a> at start-up organizations is, simply put, exceedingly difficult. Invariably, this means that most start-up organizations <strong>devolve</strong> to the point that salability reigns supreme, or <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/gettingrealaboutagiledesign/">form trumps function</a>. But whereas flexible, agile environments are very good for getting those things done, good design takes time, which makes the design process of start-ups almost universally hamstrung.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vague-velvet/4172899431/in/photostream/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/User-Experience.jpg" alt="User-Experience in Designing For Start-Ups: How To Deliver The Message Across" /></a><br /> <em>Keep the levels of UX in mind. (Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vague-velvet/4172899431/in/photostream/">Jon and Barb</a>)</em></p><p>In short, <a href="http://www.andersramsay.com/" rel="nofollow">agile, user-centered design</a> tends to ignore the aesthetic, intangible, <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/ambient-user-experience/">ambient</a> qualities that good experiences are all about. As a consequence, budding <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/art-direction-and-design/">artistic directors</a>, brand ninjas and interaction designers have been <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2009/12/01/our-misguided-focus-on-brand-and-user-experience-how-a-pursuit-of-a-“total-user-experience”-has-derailed-the-creative-pursuits-of-the-fortune-500/">apt to worry</a>. Without the ability to intimately understand the audience for whom they’re designing, <strong>these team members can’t do their jobs</strong>. The logical question becomes, how <em>can</em> they? How can designers effectively communicate with an audience they’ve yet to meet?</p><p>The textbook definition(s) of UX design yields some clue. User-centered designers are encouraged to perform <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/complete-beginners-guide-to-design-research/">design research</a> and then create personas as well as other deliverables. Certainly <em>those</em> would spotlight the factors that affect a company’s relationship with its users… right? Perhaps. While research is undoubtedly necessary to the design process, its deliverables are not.</p><p>I’ve written before that designers should <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/three-steps-to-fostering-a-user-centered-design-culture/">bootstrap their own culture of UX</a> within an organization. In this article, I’ll take that idea one step further: in order for a start-up to effectively communicate with its target audience, a spirit of empathy must pervade its every design decision &mdash; empathy cultivated by engaging in an ongoing, outward, <strong>user-centered conversation.</strong></p><h3>Where Has All The Empathy Gone?</h3><p>The task of any designer who works in a start-up environment requires <strong>empathy</strong>. The designer, perhaps more than any other team member, must empathize with stakeholders (to understand the project’s business objectives), developers (to understand its technical requirements) and, of course, users (to understand the nature of the problem they’re solving), all at once. Designing with consideration for all <a href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000029.php">three parties</a> effectively frames their strife.</p><p>Valuable though it may be, however, most start-up environments discourage empathy. Consider the number of times you’ve heard something like, “We’re targeting wealthy single males, ages 45 to 55,” or “We’re just like Amazon, but for baby boomers.” Well, that’s just great. A product description like that might initially help a team grok (a word that, ironically, means “understand by empathy”) an idea, but as far as rhetoric goes, <strong>merely saying that you know what segment you’re targeting isn’t enough.</strong></p><p><em>Every</em> e-commerce company sells products. Newcomers to the space can, and often do, learn a lot by studying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path">desire paths</a> paved by industry notables (indeed, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Anatomy-Interaction-Design-Frameworks/dp/0321635027" rel="nofollow">entire books</a> are written on the subject). But let’s be clear: “I want to be Amazon” doesn’t imbue the designer with empathy. Creating something that looks and feels like Amazon will, of course, look and feel like Amazon. If that website is then marketed to a wholly different crowd, then the resulting outfit will be <strong>disingenuous</strong> &mdash; the polar opposite of empathetic.</p><p>In order to create something real, unique, of lasting value and with a look and feel of its own, members of start-up teams must vacate their cubicles.</p><h3>One… Erm, Three Processes</h3><p>Adding to this perceived resistance are the various <strong>processes</strong> that drive start-up organizations at any given time. A <a href="http://whitneyhess.com/blog/2010/11/22/a-plan-of-action/">recent blog post by Whitney Hess</a> contrasts three specific types. It’s worth noting that all of the approaches detailed below show the exact same verbs in the exact same sequence. What’s different in each is <strong>the primary action that drives change</strong> along the way.</p><p>To cite Hess:</p><p><img src="http://www.uxbooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/reactive.jpg" alt="Reactive in Designing For Start-Ups: How To Deliver The Message Across"  /></p><blockquote cite="http://whitneyhess.com/blog/2010/11/22/a-plan-of-action/"><p>I see a lot of products developed using the Reactive Procedure:</p><ol><li>I’m scratching my itch.</li><li>Should I keep scratching this itch?</li><li>I’ll scratch this other itch.</li></ol></blockquote><p>As a designer who frequently consults with agile start-ups, I concur with Whitney’s sentiments: the reactive approach (“build it and they will come”) is far and away the most common. There is, of course, a good reason for all that <em>act</em>ion: development drives change. Start-ups <em>act</em> in order to build an initial <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/considering-prototypes/">prototype</a>. Prototypes, in turn, move the company &mdash; indeed, the user feedback loop &mdash; forward.</p><p>Unfortunately, the prototypes developed by most start-ups exhibit a keen lack of consideration. Who is the prototype targeted at? 40 to 50 somethings? There are certainly a lot of them. Will those 40 to 50 somethings be able to grok it? That is, will users be able to tell what it’s “all about” from the design? Because this kind of subjectivity is incredibly nebulous, prudent start-ups rely on experienced UX designers to help them uncover the answers. It’s no wonder that Whitney and I see this in our line of work.</p><p><img src="http://www.uxbooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/preactive.jpg" alt="Preactive in Designing For Start-Ups: How To Deliver The Message Across"  /></p><blockquote><p>As a user experience designer, consultant and member of the New York tech community, I instead advocate for using the Preactive Procedure:</p><ol><li>Who’s itchy?</li><li>That itch isn’t being scratched.</li><li>This is how to scratch that itch.</li></ol></blockquote><p>I believe that most UX designers would agree &mdash; dare I say, empathize &mdash; with Whitney’s prescribed preactive approach. Beginning with thinking &mdash; with <strong>research</strong> &mdash; is in a user-centered designer’s blood; it helps them understand their audience and voice their messages appropriately. Further still, “preactivity” appears to be the only real way for designers to gain empathy. But most start-up environments run counter to this approach. <strong>Act</strong>ing and <em>then</em> <strong>think</strong>ing usually leaves little room for the voice of research. Has Whitney encountered a start-up that tries to reconcile the two?</p><p>As luck would have it, she has. Whitney recently worked with an entrepreneur who marches to a different beat:</p><blockquote cite="http://whitneyhess.com/blog/2010/11/22/a-plan-of-action/"><p><a href="http://twitter.com/cmckella">Campbell McKellar</a>, founder of <a href="http://loosecubes.com/">Loosecubes</a>, is the first person to make me realize that there’s something even better than the Preactive Procedure &mdash; the <em>Proactive</em> Procedure.</p></blockquote><p><img src="http://www.uxbooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/proactive.jpg" alt="Proactive in Designing For Start-Ups: How To Deliver The Message Across"  /></p><blockquote><p>By acting sooner, you are actually achieving more. You are creating the future instead of just predicting and accommodating for it. You are inventing a new reality, based half in what people need, and half in what you want them to have. You can observe behavior sooner and course-correct. It is the most transformative of all three procedures for both the subject and the object.</p></blockquote><p>An entrepreneur at heart, I want to agree here, too. The proactive process appears to be a viable alternative to the unenviable tension between designers and developers at start-ups. But just because a group is humming along with a decision-based proactive process doesn’t mean that the organization’s designer <em>understands</em> its users any better. By UX standards, this process almost seems to disenfranchise them: it moves “thinking” &mdash; and here, I presume, research &mdash; all the way to the back of the bus.</p><p>In sum, it’s easy to envision scenarios at a start-up in which a given development process proves more valuable, more productive, than its alternative. Should the team think, act or decide? It depends. Regardless, as designers join start-ups, they’re very likely to find that design is secondary to the process unless, of course, their organization follows a preactive process. But for most start-ups, that’s simply not the case.</p><p>In order for an organization to learn more about its users, the design-minded members must <em>advocate</em> to that effect, changing the way that design is approached. Designers must stand up for their part of the process. As UX designer Joshua Porter <a href="http://bokardo.com/archives/personas-and-the-advantage-of-designing-for-yourself/" rel="nofollow">attests</a>, “The further a designer is from the people they’re designing for, the harder it is to design for them.”</p><p>Start-ups &mdash; or more specifically, the designers at start-ups &mdash; need to get as close to users as they can. Product development can’t rest in the entrepreneurs’ and/or the developers’ hands alone.</p><h3>Why Design Fails</h3><p>When asked, most designers don’t take long to provide honest, valid reasons why the design process is important to developers and entrepreneurs alike. There is firm precedent to that end, and they are designers by choice, after all. But just because the truth and beauty of good design is evident to most designers doesn’t exactly mean that their colleagues share their sentiments.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64519085@N00/5176903453/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/making-dollars.jpg" width="502" height="388" alt="Making-dollars in Designing For Start-Ups: How To Deliver The Message Across" /></a><br /><em>If it isn&#8217;t making Dollars&#8230; (Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64519085@N00/5176903453/">Kristian Bjornard</a>)</em></p><p>Start-ups &mdash; and more importantly, the individuals who comprise them &mdash; have a great number of mental hurdles standing in the way of their empathy with end users. The aforementioned quickened pace and changing processes aside, here are those hurdles:</p><ul><li><strong>Start-up teams have strong convictions.</strong><br /> Anyone who believes strongly in a cause (be it an idea or a Web application… or both) will identify with it. If a designer <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/no-one-nos-learning-to-say-no-to-bad-ideas/" rel="nofollow">questions the validity of an idea</a>, then they are questioning the team. This is a difficult, integral part of the design process.</li><li><strong>Research doesn’t (immediately) sell.</strong><br /> It doesn’t take weeks of research to sell a product to someone, and given enough time a good marketer can sell anyone almost anything &mdash; especially something beautiful. As a consequence, team members are likely to judge the design book by its cover. Research rarely affects their notion of beauty.</li><li><strong>Start-ups trust results they can measure (preferably in dollars).</strong><br /> Web metrics are currently the bread and butter of <a href="http://www.performable.com/" rel="nofollow">today’s Web-savvy marketers</a>. Saying that a design is good is one thing. Saying that a design has increased conversions by 200% is another. Attaching a number to something makes entrepreneurs (and, yes, designers, too) feel better about the problem being addressed. If the current process is measurable, should an up-front design process be allowed to slow that down?</li></ul><p>In sum, short-term, yes-or-no, go-or-no-go (Decide! Act!) thinking pervades the start-up space. The reality is that most agile start-ups favor a “design-less” process. While UX designers might trust that <strong>empathy</strong> (or understanding) is tantamount to a start-up’s success, their teammates won’t necessarily believe so. In order to effect change, designers must fight for the integrity of their design from the inside out.</p><h3>Leading The Way With Empathy</h3><p>To be clear, good design doesn’t come about at start-ups just by studying the metrics generated from a prototype or by talking to users through a proxy &mdash; say, support emails. That isn’t to say that these things aren’t valuable &mdash; they certainly can (and often do) point to the consequences of prior decisions. But feedback, by definition, cannot determine the company’s next &mdash; or, more importantly, first &mdash; steps. There’s the rub. Unfortunately, that is the problem routinely faced by start-up designers.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64519085@N00/4680634219/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Create-Empathy-+-Inclusion.png" width="450" height="450" alt="Create-Empathy- -Inclusion in Designing For Start-Ups: How To Deliver The Message Across" /></a><br /><caption><em>Create Empathy and Inclusion. (Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64519085@N00/4680634219/">Kristian Bjornard</a>)</em></caption><p>No one would argue that determining what’s “good” for a Web design is subjective, which makes it a frightening prospect. As <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/powertothepeople/">D. Keith Robinson wrote on A List Apart</a> all the way back in 2005:</p><blockquote cite="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/powertothepeople/"><p>Knowing what people want on the Web can be hard. You either need to have incredible empathy or have done fairly extensive research. This empathy I’m talking about, in my opinion, can really only be built up over time observing all kinds of people doing all kinds of things on all kinds of websites and applications. Even then, as you move from project to project, the people, problems and needs change.</p></blockquote><p>With every new project comes a new target user, a new person to empathize with. And just as with meeting a new person, understanding what they like and don’t like takes time. If designers are to appeal to this new person, they first have to get to know them. As both Whitney Hess and Cennydd Bowles have asserted, focusing on a rapid proactive process &mdash; decide, act, think &mdash; gives most start-ups a solid plan of attack. Not only do teams get to test market viability first, they can then think about how they’ll differentiate the product shortly thereafter.</p><p>Yes, this process makes brand-conscious designers uneasy, and understandably so. In the beginning, though, without the context that a prototype creates, designers must lean towards the relatively “safe” side, where all interaction design begins: <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/creating-usable-links-and-buttons/">buttons look like buttons</a>, drop-downs look like drop-downs and perhaps even the names of start-ups <a href="http://www.dotomator.com/web20.html">sound like start-ups</a>. Robert Hoekman, Jr. calls this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/032145345X?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=uxbo09-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=032145345X" rel="nofollow">Designing the Obvious</a>. I call it designing <strong>the boring bits</strong>.</p><p>Because what this approach makes up for in usability, it certainly lacks in propriety. <strong>To determine what’s appropriate (which is subjective), designers must conduct field research.</strong></p><h4>Hold Your Own Convictions</h4><p>Plenty of UX designers preach preactivity; they are the ones who want to understand &mdash; to empathize with &mdash; their audience and build something tailored to them. Moreover, these designers have the relative luxury of working within organizations. For them, Cennydd Bowles and James Box have written a lovely book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045JKJ7G?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=uxbo09-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0045JKJ7G"><em>Undercover User Experience Design</em></a>. If you’re at a company where design is ailing and you want to fix it, I suggest picking up a copy right away.</p><p>If you’re an independent consultant or a designer working with a start-up that’s out to craft the best possible experience, then I would suggest a couple of things, all centered on the same concept, which is to make <strong>listening</strong> a part of the company’s design process:</p><ol><li><strong>Create a design strategy.</strong><br /> Articulate who you’ll be designing for (even if they’re only make-believe) and how they’ll use the website. I’ve written before <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/focusing-interaction-design-with-design-strategy/">how I do this</a>. Regardless of how you do it, <strong>know who you’re trying to know</strong>.</li><li><strong>Have a solution.</strong><br /> Work with a development team to <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/considering-prototypes/">generate a quick prototype</a> that demonstrates your best (albeit uninformed) solution. Have at least two people use the prototype the way it is intended to be used. Befriend them, and see if they’ll contribute feedback as you refine your vision.</li><li><strong>See for yourself.</strong><br /> Finally, and most importantly, <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2010/03/17/see-for-yourself-about-the-power-of-observing/" rel="nofollow">see for yourself</a>. Visit your users in their natural environment, and make sure their concerns are addressed. If you’re in a position to do this, ask them questions related to the problem your start-up addresses.</li></ol><p>In all cases, start-up designers should center their design process on <strong>listening</strong> to users. Instead of speaking <em>to</em> users by way of the design, converse <em>with</em> users to inform the design. Empathy, the human connection, makes or breaks an informed experience.</p><p>Because most of us work behind computers for hours, days or weeks at a time, gaining empathy is obviously easier said than done. However, empathy is the only way to turn a good business idea into a well-articulated design conversation. Respect is earned, a brand is born, when every interaction that an organization has with its users is open, earnest, honest and, most of all, appropriate.</p><h3>Related Resources</h3><ul><li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/gettingrealaboutagiledesign/" rel="nofollow">Getting Real About Agile Design</a>, Cennydd Bowyles on A List Apart</li><li><a href="http://bokardo.com/archives/personas-and-the-advantage-of-designing-for-yourself/" rel="nofollow">Personas and the Advantage of Designing for Yourself</a>, Joshua Porter on Bokardo</li><li><a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/complete-beginners-guide-to-design-research/" rel="nofollow">The Complete Beginner’s Guide to Design Research</a>, Andrew Maier on UX Booth</li><li> <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2009/12/01/our-misguided-focus-on-brand-and-user-experience-how-a-pursuit-of-a-“total-user-experience”-has-derailed-the-creative-pursuits-of-the-fortune-500/" rel="nofollow">Our Misguided Focus on Brand and User Experience</a>, Jon Kolko</li><li><a href="http://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/post/2010/08/25/empathy-and-web-design.aspx" rel="nofollow">Empathy and Web Design</a>, Janko Jovanovic</li><li><a href="http://designinformer.com/giving-users-some-credit/" rel="nofollow">Giving Users Some Credit</a>, Jeremy Girard on Design Informer</li><li><a href="http://52weeksofux.com/tagged/week_32" rel="nofollow">“CopyCat Design” and “UX Won’t Save You,”</a> 52 Weeks of UX</li><li><a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2008/08/alans_keynote_at_agile_2008.html" rel="nofollow">Alan Cooper’s keynote</a>, Agile 2008</li><li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/marsvenus/" rel="nofollow">Usability Experts Are From Mars, Graphic Designers Are From Venus</a>, Curt Cloninger</a></li><li><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/690-ask-37signals-personas" rel="nofollow">Personas?</a>, Ask 37signals</li><li><a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/five_design_decision_styles/" rel="nofollow">5 Design Decision Styles.

The eBooks contain selections of articles that were published on Smashing Magazine in 2010 and 2011, as well as some exclusive articles. The previously published articles have, however, been revised, polished and carefully edited and prepared for the eBook versions (in PDF, ePUB and Mobipocket formats).</p><p>We are glad to present the three new eBooks that were released just recently.</p><h3>Professional Web Design, Volume 2 (eBook #7)</h3><p><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=smashing-ebook-web-design-2">This eBook</a> is the second part of the best-selling eBook #1. It contains 20 articles that cover current Web design trends, responsive Web design, user experience design, HTML5, usability and prototyping. The eBook describes existing and upcoming trends and explains how Web design could evolve in the coming months and years. It also touches on what Web designers should be ready for to keep abreast of new challenges and opportunities.</p><p><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=smashing-ebook-web-design-2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-91448" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ebook-7-cover.jpg" alt="Ebook-7-cover in New Smashing eBooks: Professional Design, Web Typography, Lost Files" width="300" height="356" /></a></p><p><strong>Download the eBook:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/downloadable/download/sample/sample_id/29/">Free sample:  PDF, ePUB, Mobipocket (.zip, 5Mb)</a></li><li><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=smashing-ebook-web-design-2">Buy the eBook for $9.90</a></li></ul><p>Professional Web Design, Volume 2 is available in PDF, ePub and Mobipocket formats. It is, as always, DRM-free and costs just $9.90.</p><h3>Getting The Hang Of Web Typography (eBook #6)</h3><p><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=smashing-ebook-typography">Getting the Hang of Web Typography</a> is dedicated to Web workers who deal with typography in their daily lives but have no special training for this distinct craft. This eBook gives you the necessary background on macro- and microtypography, helping you to choose suitable fonts and use modern techniques such as Web font embedding. It&#8217;s a valuable book that will help you create rich, sophisticated websites with beautiful and elegant Web typography.</p><p><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=smashing-ebook-typography"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90214" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/6-cover.jpg" alt="6-cover in New Smashing eBooks: Professional Design, Web Typography, Lost Files" width="300" height="388" /></a></p><p><strong>Download the eBook:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/downloadable/download/sample/sample_id/32/">Free sample: PDF, ePUB and Mobipocket (ZIP, 4.8 MB)</a></li><li><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=smashing-ebook-typography">Buy the eBook for $9.90</a></li></ul><p>This eBook is available in PDF, ePub and Mobipocket formats. It is, as always, DRM-free and costs just $9.90.</p><h3>Check Out Our Free eBook!</h3><p>If you would prefer to try out an eBook first instead of buying a “pig in a poke,” please feel free to download our free eBook “The Lost Files.” Initially, the <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=smashing-book-2">Smashing Book 2</a> was supposed to contain more chapters, but because most of our contributors delivered (much) more content than the book’s size could accommodate, we couldn’t include them all. So, we released four chapters as a free bonus eBook, called “The Lost Files.”</p><p>To download your free copy, just <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/customer/account/create/">register an account in the Smashing Shop</a>, and go to My Profile → My Downloadable Products. You don’t have to buy anything: registration is free and takes just few seconds.</p><p><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=ebook-the-lost-files"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/lost-files.jpg" alt="Lost-files in New Smashing eBooks: Professional Design, Web Typography, Lost Files" width="300" height="388" /></a></p><h3>New Bundle</h3><p>You can also get the latest five books in the Smashing eBook series by buying them as a bundle. All books are available in PDF, ePUB and Mobipocket formats:</p><ul><li><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=smashing-ebook-bundle-3-7">Smashing eBook Bundle</a> — eBook numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 — for $39.50</li></ul><h3>Why Would Anyone Buy An eBook?</h3><p>Good question. While so much content is available online for free, eBooks tend to feel a bit more permanent, secure and reliable and are often much better optimized for reading than Web pages. eBooks are usually carefully edited, organized and prepared. Compared to printed books, eBooks present many advantages:</p><ul><li><strong>Immediately available</strong><br /> You can purchase, download and start reading eBooks within minutes. You do not have to travel to a bookstore to buy them, nor do you have to wait days or weeks for them to arrive by mail.</li><li><strong>Portable</strong><br /> You can carry all of your books with you on a laptop, smartphone or eBook reader, without worrying about weight. Also, being so small in file size, they are much more convenient for reading offline and on smartphones.</li><li><strong>Adaptable</strong><br /> Modern eBook formats (ePUB, Mobipocket) are designed with reflowable text, which means that the presentation of content is optimized for the display it is being viewed on.</li><li><strong>Searchable</strong><br /> With built-in search functionality, you can easily search for keywords and even long passages of text.</li><li><strong>Interactive</strong><br /> Digital books are able to contain audio and video, which can complement or add to the message of the authors.</li><li><strong>Adjustable font size</strong><br /> Users of eBook readers can easily increase the font size of books and sometimes even change the font itself, which makes the format ideal for the elderly and people with disabilities. Also, with the emergence of high-resolution displays, digital text can appear very sharp and crisp on the screen, very much like ink on paper.</li><li><strong>Bookmarks, highlighting and notes</strong><br /> Advanced eBook readers automatically remember where you’ve stopped reading whenever you close a book. They also allow you to bookmark pages, highlight favorite passages and make notes.</li><li><strong>Built-in dictionary</strong><br /> Some eBook readers offer a built-in dictionary, which are especially helpful to non-native speakers.</li><li><strong>Text-to-speech functionality</strong><br /> The latest eBook readers have built-in text-to-speech functionality, which is particularly useful on small mobile devices. Rest your eyes after a long day in front of the computer.</li></ul><h3>All Smashing eBooks: Overview</h3><p>Here is what we have to offer. All eBooks are available in PDF, ePUB and Mobipocket formats, and they are free of DRM.</p><table id="terms" style="border-collapse: collapse; margin: 10px 0;"><tbody><tr><td class="cover"><a

Accompanying this release was the brand new default theme, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyten">TwentyTen</a>, and the promise of a new default theme every year. Somewhat surprisingly, TwentyTen declares the HTML5 doctype but doesn’t take advantage of many of the new elements and attributes that HTML5 brings.</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-90689" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/WordPress-HTML5.jpg" alt="WordPress-HTML5 in Using HTML5 To Transform WordPress’ TwentyTen Theme" width="500" height="337" /></p><p>Now, HTML5 does many things, but you can’t just add <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code> to the top of a document and get excited that you’re <em>so</em> 2011. Mark-up, as they say, is meaning, and HTML5 brings a whole bunch of meaning to our documents.</p><p>In a <a href="http://css-tricks.com/poll-results-html5-on-new-projects/">recent survey</a> by Chris Coyier over at CSS-Tricks, almost two thirds of respondents said they would not use HTML5 in new projects. In a <a href="http://polldaddy.com/poll/4518784/?view=results" target="_blank">similar survey by Smashing Magazine</a> the results were almost identical: only 37% of voters said they use HTML5. This is depressing reading. Perhaps developers and designers are scared off by cross-browser incompatibility and the chore of learning new mark-up. The truth is that with a pinch of JavaScript, HTML5 can be used safely today across all browsers, back to IE6.</p><p>WordPress seems to sympathize with the majority of CSS-Tricks’ readers.  TwentyTen is a fine theme that <a href="http://2010dev.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/valid-html5/">already validates as HTML5</a>; but in order to cater to users without JavaScript, it has to forgo a large chunk of HTML5 elements. The reason? Our old friend Internet Explorer doesn’t support most of them prior to version 9.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/TwentyTenDefault.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-88016" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/TwentyTenDefault.jpg" alt="TwentyTenDefault in Using HTML5 To Transform WordPress’ TwentyTen Theme" width="550" height="400" /></a><br /> <em>The default TwentyTen WordPress Theme.</em></p><p>For example, you’ve probably already heard of the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tags, both of which are champing at the bit to be embedded in a WordPress template. But to use these HTML5 elements in IE8 (and its predecessors), you need JavaScript in order to create them in the DOM. If you don’t have JavaScript, then the elements can’t be styled with CSS. Turn off JavaScript and you turn off the styling for these elements; invariably, this will break the formatting of your page.</p><p>I assume that WordPress decided to exclude these problematic tags so that its default theme would be supported by all browsers &mdash; not just those with JavaScript turned on.</p><p>While I understand this decision, I also think it’s a mistake. Three core technologies make the Web work: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All desktop browsers support them (to some degree), so if any one of them off is disabled the user will have to expect a degraded experience. JavaScript is now fundamental to the user experience and while we should support users who turn off JavaScript, or have it turned off for them and have no chance to turn it on again as they don&#8217;t have the right to do so, I question just <em>how far</em> we should support them.</p><h4>Why Using JavaScript Makes Sense</h4><p>Yahoo gives <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/10/how-many-users-have-javascript-disabled/">compelling evidence</a> that less than 1.5% of its users turn off JavaScript. My own research into this, ably assisted by Greig Daines at eConversions, puts the figure below 0.5% (based on millions of visitors to a UK retail website).</p><p>Whilst it&#8217;s true that JavaScript <em>should</em> be separated from a site&#8217;s content, design and structure the reality is no longer black and white. I strongly believe that the benefits and opportunities HTML5 brings, together with related technologies such as CSS3 and media queries (both of which sometimes rely on JavaScript for cross-browser compatibility), is more than enough reason to use JavaScript to &#8216;force&#8217; new elements to work in Internet Explorer. I am a passionate advocate for standards-based design that doesn&#8217;t rely on JavaScript; HTML5 is the one structural exception.</p><p>Yes, we should respect a user&#8217;s decision to deactivate JavaScript in their browser. However, I don&#8217;t believe that this is a good enough reason for not using modern technologies, which would provide the vast majority of users with a richer user experience. After all, in the TwentyTen example, if the theme had HTML5 tags in it, everything would look fine in modern browsers (latest versions of Safari, Firefox, Opera, Chrome and IE9), with or without JavaScript.</p><p>If the browser is IE6 – IE8, and JavaScript is turned off, then users would see the content but it will not be styled correctly. If the content would not be displayed at all, we&#8217;d have a completely different discussion. If you are still not convinced, I will briefly discuss another option for those who <em>absolutely must</em> support users with JavaScript turned off.</p><p>To make TwentyTen play fair with IE, I suggest <a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/">Remy Sharp’s HTML5 shim</a> or, if you want to sink your teeth into CSS3, <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a>. Modernizr not only adds support for HTML5 elements in IE but also tells you which CSS3 properties are supported by the user’s browser by adding special classes to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-88243" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mordernizr.jpg" alt="Mordernizr in Using HTML5 To Transform WordPress’ TwentyTen Theme" width="550" height="355" /><br /> <em>Mordernizr.js</em></p><p>So, let’s assume you’ve rightly banished non-JavaScript users with a polite message in a <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag. We can now start tinkering under the hood of TwentyTen to bring some more HTML5 to WordPress.</p><h3>Upgrading To HTML5</h3><p>TwentyTen gets a number of things spot on. First of all, it declares the right doctype and includes the abbreviated meta <code>charset</code> tag. It also uses other semantic goodness like Microformats and great accessibility features like WAI-ARIA. But we can go further.</p><p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p><ul><li>I am referencing the HTML generated at <a href="http://wp-themes.com/twentyten/">http://wp-themes.com/twentyten/</a>, rather than the simple “Hello World” clean installation of WordPress 3.</li><li>For this article, I’ll be editing the files directly in the <code>/wp-content/themes/twentyten/</code> directory. I’ve provided all the updated HTML5 theme source files for you to download from <a href="http://www.twentytenfive.com/">TwentyTen Five</a>.</li><li>Line numbers may change over time, so when I reference one, I’ll usually say “on or around line…” The version of WordPress at the time of writing is 3.0.4.</li></ul><h4>Articles</h4><p>One of the more confusing parts of the HTML5 spec is the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tags. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? The easiest way to remember is to refer to the specification. The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">HTML5 spec</a> may be dry at the best of times, but its <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-article-element">explanation of articles</a> will always point you in the right direction:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>article</code> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site   and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication.</p></blockquote><p>If the piece of content in question can be, and most likely will be, syndicated by RSS, then there’s a good chance it’s an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. A blog post in WordPress fits the bill perfectly.</p><p>On the TwentyTen home page, we get the following HTML:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;div id="post-19"&gt;
…
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre><p>Semantically this means very little. But with the simple addition of an <code>article</code> tag, we’re able to transform it into mark-up with meaning.</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;article id="post-19"&gt;
…
&lt;/article&gt;
</pre><p>Note that we retain the <code>id</code> to ensure that this <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> remains unique.</p><p>To make this change in the TwentyTen theme, open <em>loop.php</em>, which is in <code>/wp-content/themes/twentyten/</code>. On or around line 61, you should find the following code:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;div id="post-&lt;?php the_ID(); ?&gt;" &lt;?php post_class(); ?&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>We’ll need to change that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, so that it reads:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;article id="post-&lt;?php the_ID(); ?&gt;" &lt;?php post_class(); ?&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>And then we close it again on or around line 97, so that…</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #post-## --&gt;
</pre><p>… becomes:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;/article&gt;&lt;!-- #post-## --&gt;
</pre><p>There are also instances on lines 32, 101 and 124. Opening some of the other pages in the theme, for example <em>single.php</em>, and making the same change is worthwhile. Thus, line 22 in <em>single.php </em>would change from…</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;div id="post-&lt;?php the_ID(); ?&gt;" &lt;?php post_class(); ?&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>… to:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;article id="post-&lt;?php the_ID(); ?&gt;" &lt;?php post_class(); ?&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>And line 55 would change from…</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #post-## --&gt;
</pre><p>… to:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;/article&gt;&lt;!-- #post-## --&gt;
</pre><p>So far, so good. These are simple changes, but they already serve to overhaul the semantics of the website.</p><h4>Time and Date</h4><p>According to the HTML5 spec:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element either represents a time on a 24-hour clock, or a precise date on the proleptic Gregorian calendar, optionally with a time and a time-zone offset.</p></blockquote><p>This means we can give the date and time of an article’s publication more context with HTML5’s <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag. Look at the code that WordPress generates:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;a href="http://wp-themes.com/?p=19" title="4:33 am"
rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;span&gt;October 17, 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre><p>We can add meaning to our mark-up by transposing this to:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;a href="http://wp-themes.com/?p=19" title="4:33 am"
rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2008-10-17T04:33Z"
pubdate&gt;October 17, 2008&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre><p>This time is now machine-readable, and the browser can now interact with the date in many ways should we so wish. I’ve also added the boolean attribute <code>pubdate</code>, which designates this as the date on which the article or content was published.</p><p>Time in the <code>datetime</code> attribute is optional, but because WordPress includes it when you post an article, we can too. Implementing this in TwentyTen requires us to dig a little deeper. In <em>loop.php</em>, the following function on or around line 65 calls for the date to be included:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;?php twentyten_posted_on(); ?&gt;
</pre><p>To make our HTML5 changes, let’s head over to <code>/wp-content/themes/twentyten/</code> and open <em>functions.php</em>. On or around line 441, you’ll see this:</p><pre class="brush: php">function twentyten_posted_on() {
printf( __( '&lt;span&gt;Posted on&lt;/span&gt; %2$s &lt;span&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; %3$s', 'twentyten' ),
'meta-prep meta-prep-author',
sprintf( '&lt;a href="%1$s" title="%2$s" rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;span&gt;%3$s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;',
get_permalink(),
esc_attr( get_the_time() ),
get_the_date()
),
</pre><p>If you don’t know what that means, don’t worry. We’re focusing on the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php">sprintf</a> function, which basically takes a string and inserts the variables that are returned by the three functions listed: that is, <code>get_permanlink()</code>, <code>get_the_time()</code> and <code>get_the_date()</code> are inserted into <code>%1$s</code>, <code>%2$s</code> and <code>%3$s</code>, respectively.</p><p>We need to change how the date is formatted, so we’ll have to add a fourth function: <code>get_the_date('c')</code>. WordPress will then return the date in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format, which is exactly what the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element requires. Our finished code looks like this:</p><pre class="brush: php">printf( __( 'Posted on %2$s by %3$s', 'twentyten' ),
'meta-prep meta-prep-author',
sprintf( '&lt;a href="%1$s" rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;time datetime="%2$s"
pubdate&gt;%3$s&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;',
get_permalink(),
get_the_date('c'),
get_the_date()
),
</pre><p>I’ve included <code>get_the_date()</code> twice because we need two different formats: one for the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element and one that’s displayed to the user. I’ve also removed <code>title="[time published]"</code> because that information is already included in the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element.</p><p>For more details on WordPress’ date and time functions, check out:</p><ul><li><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_the_time">Function Reference/get the time</a>,</li><li><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time">Formatting Date and Time</a>.</li></ul><h4>Figures</h4><p>A figure—for our purposes at least—is a piece of media that you upload in WordPress to embed in a post. The most obvious example would be an image, but it could be a video, too, of course. WordPress 3 is helpful enough to add captions to images when you first import the images, but it doesn’t display those captions using the new HTML5 <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tags.</p><p>The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-figure-element">spec defines</a> <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> as follows:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>figure</code> element represents a unit of content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained, that is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document, and that can be moved away from the main flow of the document without affecting the document’s meaning.</p></blockquote><p>And it defines <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> like so:</p><blockquote><p>The <code>figcaption</code> element represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents of the <code>figcaption</code> element’s parent <code>figure</code> element, if any.</p></blockquote><p>Currently an image with a caption is rendered like this:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;div class="wp-caption" style="width: 445px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boat"
src="http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/boat.jpg"
title="Boat" width="435" height="288" /&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Boat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre><p><img class="size-full wp-image-88242" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/boat.jpg" alt="Boat in Using HTML5 To Transform WordPress’ TwentyTen Theme" width="453" height="323" /><br /> <em>A WordPress image with a caption.</em></p><p>Changing this HTML to include HTML5 elements requires us to first look at <em>media.php</em> in the <code>/wp-includes/</code> directory, where this code is generated. On or around line 739, you’ll find:</p><pre class="brush: php">return '&lt;div ' . $id . 'class="wp-caption ' . esc_attr($align) . '" style="width: ' . (10 + (int) $width) . 'px"&gt;'
. do_shortcode( $content ) . '&lt;p&gt;' . $caption . '&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';
</pre><p>To upgrade this to HTML5, we need to define a new function that outputs our <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>-based HTML and assign this function to the same shortcode that calls <code>img_caption_shortcode()</code>. I’ve done this in <code>/wp-content/themes/twentyten/functions.php</code> by adding the following to the bottom of the file:</p><pre class="brush: php">add_shortcode('wp_caption', 'twentyten_img_caption_shortcode');
add_shortcode('caption', 'twentyten_img_caption_shortcode');

function twentyten_img_caption_shortcode($attr, $content = null) {

extract(shortcode_atts(array(
'id'    =&gt; '',
'align'    =&gt; 'alignnone',
'width'    =&gt; '',
'caption' =&gt; ''
), $attr));

if ( 1 &gt; (int) $width || empty($caption) )
return $content;

if ( $id ) $idtag = 'id="' . esc_attr($id) . '" ';

  return '&lt;figure ' . $idtag . 'aria-describedby="figcaption_' . $id . '" style="width: ' . (10 + (int) $width) . 'px"&gt;'
  . do_shortcode( $content ) . '&lt;figcaption id="figcaption_' . $id . '"&gt;' . $caption . '&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;';
}
</pre><p>First, we point the shortcodes for <code>wp-caption</code> and <code>caption</code> to our new function <code>twentyten_img_caption_shortcode()</code>. Then, we simply copy the original function from <em>media.php</em>, and change the last few lines to include our <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element. This now renders our <em>boat.jpg</em> example from above like so:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;figure id="attachment_64" style="width: 445px;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/boat.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img title="boat" src="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/boat.jpg"
alt="Screenshot" width="435" height="288" aria-describedby="figcaption_attachment_64"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_64"&gt;Boat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
</pre><h4>The Comments Form</h4><p>One of the biggest improvements introduced in HTML5 is how form fields work and respond to user input. We can take advantage of these changes by using HTML5 form elements in the default WordPress comments form in three ways:</p><ol><li>We can set the text-input type to <code>email</code> and <code>url</code> for the relevant fields. This not only more accurately describes the input field, but also adds better keyboard functionality for the iPhone, for example.</li><li>We can add the boolean attribute <code>required</code> to our required form fields. This goes beyond WAI-ARIA’s <code>aria-required='true'</code> because it invokes the browser’s own <code>required</code> behavior.</li><li>We can add placeholder text to our form fields, a popular JavaScript method that is now handled in-browser. Placeholder text allows you to go into more detail about what information is required than a form label generally allows.</li></ol><p>Before adding HTML, a typical comment input field might look like this:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;label for="email"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt; &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;input id="email" name="email" type="text" value=""
size="30" aria-required='true' /&gt;
</pre><p>After our HTML5 changes, it would look like this:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;label for="email"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt; &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;input id="email" name="email" type="email" value=""
size="30" aria-required='true'
placeholder="How can we reach you?" required /&gt;
</pre><p>To make these improvements in the code, we need to do two things. First, we need to change the HTML for the default fields (name, email address and website URL), and then we need to change it for the comment’s <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>. We can achieve both of these changes with additional filters and custom functions.</p><p>To change the HTML for the default form fields, we need to add the following filter to the bottom of <em>functions.php</em>:</p><pre class="brush: php">add_filter('comment_form_default_fields', 'twentytenfive_comments');
</pre><p>And then we have to create our custom function <code>twentytenfive_comments()</code> to change how these fields are displayed. We can do so by creating an array containing our new form fields and then returning it to this filter. Here’s the function:</p><pre class="brush: php">function twentytenfive_comments() {

$req = get_option('require_name_email');

$fields =  array(
'author' =&gt; '&lt;p&gt;' . '&lt;label for="author"&gt;' . __( 'Name' ) . '&lt;/label&gt; ' . ( $req ? '&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;' : '' ) .
'&lt;input id="author" name="author" type="text" value="' . esc_attr( $commenter['comment_author'] ) . '" size="30"' . $aria_req . ' placeholder = "What should we call you?"' . ( $req ? ' required' : '' ) . '/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;',

'email'  =&gt; '&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for="email"&gt;' . __( 'Email' ) . '&lt;/label&gt; ' . ( $req ? '&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;' : '' ) .
'&lt;input id="email" name="email" type="email" value="' . esc_attr(  $commenter['comment_author_email'] ) . '" size="30"' . $aria_req . ' placeholder="How can we reach you?"' . ( $req ? ' required' : '' ) . ' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;',

'url'    =&gt; '&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for="url"&gt;' . __( 'Website' ) . '&lt;/label&gt;' .
'&lt;input id="url" name="url" type="url" value="' . esc_attr( $commenter['comment_author_url'] ) . '" size="30" placeholder="Have you got a website?" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'

);
return $fields;
}
</pre><p>You can see here that each element in the form has a name in the <code>array()</code>: author, email and url. We then type in our custom code, which contains the new HTML5 form attributes. We have added placeholder text to each of the elements and, where required, added the boolean <code>required</code> attribute (and we need to check if the admin has made these fields required using the <code>get_option()</code> function). We’ve also added the correct input type to the inputs for author, email address and website URL.</p><p>Finally, we need to add some HTML5 to the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, which is home to the user’s comments. We have to use another filter here, also in <em>functions.php</em>:</p><pre class="brush: php">add_filter('comment_form_field_comment', 'twentytenfive_commentfield');
</pre><p>We follow this with another custom function:</p><pre class="brush: php">function twentytenfive_commentfield() {

$commentArea = '&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for="comment"&gt;' . _x( 'Comment', 'noun' ) . '&lt;/label&gt;&lt;textarea id="comment" name="comment" cols="45" rows="8" aria-required="true" required placeholder="What\'s on your mind?"    &gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/p&gt;';

return $commentArea;

}
</pre><p>This is more or less the same as the default <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, except with <code>placeholder</code> and <code>required</code> attributes.</p><p>You can control exactly which fields appear in your form with these two filters, so feel free to add more if you want to collect more information.</p><p>Although relatively simple, these changes to the comment form provide additional (and useful!) features to users with latest-generation browsers. Look in Opera, Chrome (which doesn’t yet support <code>required</code>) or Firefox 4 to see the results.</p><h4>Header, Navigation and Footer</h4><p>We finally get around to inserting the new <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements. Currently, the code in <code>/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php</code> looks more or less like this:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;div id="header"&gt;
&lt;div id="masthead"&gt;
&lt;div id="branding" role="banner"&gt;
…
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #branding --&gt;

&lt;div id="access" role="navigation"&gt;
…
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #access --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #masthead --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #header --&gt;
</pre><p>It doesn’t take a genius to see that we can easily make this HTML5-ready by changing some of those divs to include <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>.</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;header id="header"&gt;
&lt;section id="masthead" &gt;
&lt;div id="branding" role="banner"&gt;
…
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #branding --&gt;

&lt;nav id="access" role="navigation"&gt;
…
&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;!-- #access --&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;!-- #masthead --&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- #header --&gt;
</pre><p>You can see that we’ve left the WAI-ARIA role of <code>navigation</code> assigned to the <code>nav</code> element—simply to offer the broadest possible support to all browsers and screen readers.</p><p>I have replaced the <code>#masthead</code> div with a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> because all of the elements in this area relate to one another and are likely to appear in a document outline. It seems you could delete this section altogether and just apply 30 pixels of <code>padding-top</code> to the header to maintain the layout. I’ve maintained the elements’ <code>id</code>s in case more than one of each are on the page—multiple headers, footers and navs (and more) are all welcome in HTML5.</p><p>While we’re editing the header, we can introduce the new <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-hgroup-element">&lt;hgroup&gt;</a> element. This element enables us to include multiple headings in a section of our document, while they would be treated as just one heading in the document outline. Currently, the code on or around line 65 in <em>header.php</em> looks like this:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;?php $heading_tag = ( is_home() || is_front_page() ) ? 'h1' : 'div'; ?&gt;
&lt;&lt;?php echo $heading_tag; ?&gt; id="site-title"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="&lt;?php echo home_url( '/' ); ?&gt;" title="&lt;?php echo esc_attr( get_bloginfo( 'name', 'display' ) ); ?&gt;" rel="home"&gt;&lt;?php bloginfo( 'name' ); ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/&lt;?php echo $heading_tag; ?&gt;&gt;
&lt;div id="site-description"&gt;&lt;?php bloginfo( 'description' ); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre><p>We can edit this to include the <code>&lt;hgroup&gt;</code> tag, and also change <code>&lt;div id="site-description"&gt;</code> to an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> element:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;hgroup&gt;
&lt;?php $heading_tag = ( is_home() || is_front_page() ) ? 'h1' : 'div'; ?&gt;
&lt;&lt;?php echo $heading_tag; ?&gt; id="site-title"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a href="&lt;?php echo home_url( '/' ); ?&gt;" title="&lt;?php echo esc_attr( get_bloginfo( 'name', 'display' ) ); ?&gt;" rel="home"&gt;&lt;?php bloginfo( 'name' ); ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/&lt;?php echo $heading_tag; ?&gt;&gt;
&lt;h2 id="site-description"&gt;&lt;?php bloginfo( 'description' ); ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/hgroup&gt;
</pre><p>In <code>/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php</code>, we have:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;div id="footer" role="contentinfo"&gt;
  &lt;div id="colophon"&gt;
  …
  &lt;div id="site-info"&gt;
    &lt;a href="&lt;?php echo home_url( '/' ) ?&gt;" title="&lt;?php echo esc_attr( get_bloginfo( 'name', 'display' ) ); ?&gt;" rel="home"&gt;
    &lt;?php bloginfo( 'name' ); ?&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #site-info --&gt;

  &lt;div id="site-generator"&gt;
  …
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #site-generator --&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #colophon --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #footer --&gt;
</pre><p>We can easily edit this to include a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> and another <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element:</p><pre class="brush: php">&lt;footer role="contentinfo"&gt;
&lt;section id="colophon"&gt;
…
&lt;div id="site-info"&gt;
&lt;a href="&lt;?php echo home_url( '/' ) ?&gt;" title="&lt;?php echo esc_attr( get_bloginfo( 'name', 'display' ) ); ?&gt;" rel="home"&gt;
&lt;?php bloginfo( 'name' ); ?&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #site-info --&gt;

&lt;div id="site-generator"&gt;
…
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- #site-generator --&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;!-- #colophon --&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;!-- #footer --&gt;
</pre><h4>JavaScript and CSS</h4><p>As mentioned, we should include an HTML5 shim or <em>Modernizr.js</em> to make sure that all of our new elements render correctly in Internet Explorer prior to version 9. I added the following line to <em>header.php</em>:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;script src="&lt;?php bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?&gt;/js/Modernizr-1.6.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre><p>A couple of things to note here. First, we no longer need <code>type="text/javascript"</code> because the browser will assume that a script is JavaScript unless it’s told different. Secondly, we have to use the WordPress <code>bloginfo()</code> function to point the source URL to our theme directory.</p><p>Although we are including Modernizr partly to make sure that IE can deal with the new HTML5 elements, I am serving it to all browsers because of the CSS3-checking functionality it provides.</p><p>In <em>style.css</em>, we need to make sure that our HTML5 elements have a <code>display: block</code> attribute, because some older browsers will treat them as inline elements. For our purposes, the following line at the top of the CSS file will do:</p><pre class="brush: css">header, nav, section, article, aside, figure, footer { display: block; }
</pre><p>While we’re talking about CSS, remember that we can now remove <code>type="text/css"</code> from our <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags. The simplified code looks like this:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="&lt;?php bloginfo( 'stylesheet_url' ); ?&gt;" /&gt;
</pre><p>That should be enough for now. Remember, though, that changing the structure of the page by replacing older HTML elements with new ones might require some additional CSS.</p><p>We should let the small minority of users know that we’ve stopped supporting browsers that have JavaScript turned off. A polite message just below the opening <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag in <em>header.php</em> should suffice:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript is required for this website to be displayed correctly. Please enable JavaScript before continuing...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
</pre><p>Add some very basic styling in <em>style.css</em> to make this message unmissable.</p><pre class="brush: css">/* A message for users with JavaScript turned off */
noscript strong {
display: block;
font-size: 18px;
line-height:1.5em;
padding: 5px 0;
background-color: #ccc;
color: #a00;
text-align: center; }
</pre><h3>Still Not Convinced? A Cross-Browser Alternative</h3><p>There is another option for those of you who absolutely <em>must</em> support users with JavaScript turned off, as suggested by <a href="http://icant.co.uk/">Christian Heilmann</a>. Simply wrap your HTML5 elements with divs which share the same ID name. For example:</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;article id="post-123"&gt;
...
&lt;/article&gt;
</pre><p>becomes</p><pre class="brush: html">&lt;div class="article"&gt;
&lt;article id="post-123"&gt;
...
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre><p>Then it&#8217;s just a case of adding <code>.article</code> to your article CSS definition. It might look like this:</p><pre class="brush: html">.article,
article { display: block; background-color: #f7f7f7; }
</pre><p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this adds another layer of markup to your code which isn&#8217;t needed for most users. I&#8217;d only recommend it if non-JavaScript users are a significant proportion of your users and/or sales.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>TwentyTen was a huge step forward for WordPress; and as a piece of HTML, it is a beacon of best practice. By including some simple JavaScript, we can now open up the theme to the world of HTML5—and the additional meaning and simpler semantic code that it offers.</p><p>While we’ve addressed a good number of new HTML5 elements in this article, it really is just a starting point and you can add many more yourself. For example, you could add headers and footers to individual posts, or you might like to add the new <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element. Let us know your ideas and how you get on with implementing them in the comments below!</p><h4>Download TwentyTen With HTML5</h4><p>To complement this article, I have created a new version of TwentyTen, with the HTML5 elements we have discussed.

It’s a question that matters a great deal to designers, yet seems to be curiously discounted in the common perception of graphic design. Any time I talk with, say, an uncle at Thanksgiving about my work, I’m reminded that, in most people&#8217;s minds, the job of being a designer is mainly a matter of learning a set of computer applications — programs which, when properly operated, presumably do the work of generating ideas on their own.</p><p>If pressed further, most people will offer up some version of the Genius Theory: the idea that certain individuals are simply blessed with a force called ‘creativity’ that (as the theory goes) allows them to summon remarkable visual solutions to problems where the rest of us see only a blank canvas.</p><p>In this article, we will look at <strong>four examples of successful visual solutions created by well-known designers</strong>, and examine the process by which each designer arrived at his final concept. In each case, we will see that the solution did not arrive as a sudden flash of inspiration from out of the blue; rather, a good idea emerged methodically out of a sensible analysis of readily-available ideas and impressions.</p><p>In particular, we will zero in on the dual role played by clichés in this process: while clichés can derail the creative process, for seasoned designers they can act as the building blocks for effective solutions by telling them what <em>not</em> to do. In the final balance, we will see that good ideas are not created by magic, nor are they generated by computers — the process of developing them is a skill that can be learned, taught and practiced, and, like a muscle, gets stronger the more it is used.</p><h3>Exhibit A: Imaginary ‘Drive Safe’ Campaign for Teens</h3><p>Suppose we are working together at a studio and we receive a job to design a poster for a public service campaign aimed at educating teenagers <strong>about the dangers posed by drinking and driving</strong>. We meet for our first internal review to critique our initial ideas, and I present the following proposal:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/unicorn2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89205" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/unicorn2.jpg" alt="Unicorn2 in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="320" height="530" /></a></p><p>In this case, the problem with my work is painfully easy to diagnose: the image simply has <strong>no connection to the message</strong>. It may or may not be nicely illustrated&#8230; but this is somewhat beside the point: unless it&#8217;s trying to speak to eight-year-old girls, this poster is not going to make a meaningful impression on its audience. If we imagine a spectrum of all possible design solutions to this job ranging from ‘totally clear’ to ‘totally unclear’, this would rank pretty far in the latter direction:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/graph12.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89212" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/graph12.jpg" alt="Graph12 in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="500" height="314" /></a></p><p>‘Fine,’ I reply, tearfully storming back to my desk. A week later, I present a revised concept, confident that it speaks to the audience more directly:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/stop4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89208" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/stop4.jpg" alt="Stop4 in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="320" height="530" /></a></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>This time, the problem is a little harder to put one’s finger on. The image communicates clearly&#8230; but it does so at the cost of boring us half to death, with no humor, inflection or engagement. Also disturbing is the fact that I’m using a pre-existing visual symbol from the urban environment — the stop sign — to do my communicating for me.</p><p>If we had never before seen a red eight-sided shape with the word ‘STOP’ inside, it might be a powerful and abstract creation; as things stand, however, the symbol has become so deadeningly familiar that it has lost all capability to impact us in a meaningful way. <strong>In my eagerness to communicate clearly, I’ve run headlong into the arms of a cliché</strong> — which, in the context of graphic design, can be defined as  ‘an image that may or may not have been memorable at one point, but has since been so overused that it has lost all ability to surprise.’</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/graph1b1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89230" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/graph1b1.jpg" alt="Graph1b1 in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="500" height="314" /></a></p><h3>The Problem of Clichés</h3><p>This imaginary case study demonstrates why clichés are such a stubborn problem for designers. In the example above, I didn’t arrive at a cliché because I’m a terrible or uncreative person; I arrived at it because I took the most readily-available solution from the environment around me, and stopped there.</p><p><strong> Clichés</strong><strong> are hard to banish from our thoughts because their sheer familiarity makes them appealing:</strong> they are always at hand, ready to be put into service; and — especially if we are working under pressure — their familiarity offers a certain amount of reassurance, a guarantee that we won’t be misunderstood. Design solutions that employ clichés are the hardest for me to critique in the feedback sessions that I run as a teacher: often, there is the frustrating sense that the student has done nothing <em>wrong</em> exactly, yet the overall design leaves us wanting more.</p><p>Most depressing of all is the fact that clients often prefer clichéd solutions to original ones. This is the syndrome of the Chinese restaurant owner who wants us to use the same tired chopstick lettering for her sign because ‘that way, people will know it&#8217;s a Chinese restaurant’. Wanting only to be correctly identified, the client is drawn to the universality of clichés: they have, after all, the same meaning for everybody within a particular culture, which — if only they weren&#8217;t so hackneyed — would make them an ideal communication tool for designers.</p><p>In the haste to fit in, the need to stand out has been forgotten. It is our responsibility as designers to make the case that design can serve both ends at once: it can speak plainly while still leaving a mark on its audience.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ethnic-signage1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89225" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ethnic-signage1.jpg" alt="Ethnic-signage1 in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="500" height="314" /></a></p><p><em>Every area of graphic design has its built-in clichés. But none more so than images that seek to convey a sense of ethnicity, where the same predictable type choices pop up again and again (shown left to right: Sunamy, Papyrus, Neuland). See Rob Giampierto&#8217;s indispensable article <a href="http://www.studio-gs.com/neuland.html">New Black Face</a> f</em><em>or more on this topic. </em></p><p>Clichés, in short, are the empty calories of the design world: like junk food, they are available everywhere and easy to consume, but pass through us without leaving nutrition behind. Their prevalence arises from the shared nervousness with which designers often view their clients and their clients view design: satisfied merely to get to the point across in an obvious manner, both sides neglect to create a message that will live in a viewer&#8217;s memory and foster long-term recognition and loyalty.</p><p>If the above hypothetical campaign has given us examples of two flawed extremes — one too obvious and the first not obvious enough — what does it look like when a designer hits the sweet spot in between? And, more importantly, how did he or she get there?</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/graph22.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89214" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/graph22.jpg" alt="Graph22 in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="500" height="314" /></a></p><h3>Exhibit B: Craig Frazier</h3><p>In 1987, the designer Craig Frazier did a poster for this very purpose, a public service campaign aimed at persuading kids to not drive home drunk from their senior high school prom. His poster:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/frazier.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89216" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/frazier.jpg" alt="Frazier in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="400" height="566" /></a></p><p>Like Goldilocks’ bowl of porridge, this solution is just right: it communicates its message with appropriate urgency, but the weapon of surprise is also part of the attack. &#8220;It has an art quality that removes it from the realm of ordinary public service campaigns,&#8221; Frazier noted in a 1996 interview with <em>Critique </em>magazine, in which he also identified it as a personal best. “It presents a visual riddle that’s almost attractive at first glance, but gets more gruesome the more you study it.”</p><p>The unconventional presentation of the subject matter requires us to spend a split second <strong>visually decoding the image</strong>, discerning its story&#8230; and, in that moment of cognitive engagement, a connection is formed between viewer and image. The abstract and original treatment of the topic allows the poster to sneak past our defenses — in Frazier&#8217;s words, &#8220;it proves that you don’t have to be condescending to convey a deadly serious message.” Whereas the Stop Sign approach droned authoritatively at its viewer, this execution lures the onlooker into a perceptual dialogue, and refrains from talking down to its touchy teenage audience (note the quiet treatment of the tagline in the lower left corner).</p><p>In sum, by avoiding an overly obvious delivery, the designer cleared the way for a work that leaves a lasting impression: “I still get tingles when I think about the poor guy on the road,&#8221; Frazier commented nearly ten years later. &#8220;I have a visceral, emotional reaction.” Impactful? Check. Emotional? Check. Clear in meaning? Check. &#8220;What makes the poster work is the same thing that makes any good ad or brochure work,&#8221; Frazier concludes: &#8220;It&#8217;s engaging and memorable to its intended audience.&#8221;</p><p>So how did he get there? Not, as my uncle might assume, by virtue of being a creative genius who effortlessly vaults over commonplace ideas (nor simply by owning a computer). Rather, to judge from his own comments, Frazier arrived at his solution by taking accurate stock of the commonplace and determining in what direction the fresh territory lay:  “These kids had already been hit with plenty of preaching and scare tactics about drunk driving and drug abuse, not only from their parents, but also the media,&#8221; the designer recalled, explaining his thought process.</p><p>&#8220;I knew what I didn’t want to do — a poster that presented the consequences in such a grizzly fashion that the student could dismiss it as another image from a Highway Patrol film. Even though I knew these images could be effective — like the ads of that time by Fallon McElliot — I wanted this poster to be gripping, not scolding.&#8221; Put in the simplest possible terms, Frazier came up with his idea by <strong>identifying the resident cliché and then setting out in the opposite direction.</strong></p><p>Simple as this approach might sound, the tangible benefits are worth taking note of:  “All reports indicated that the students received the poster well,&#8221; Frazier recalled, &#8220;and many students requested copies for their bedroom walls. The effectiveness of any poster is hard to measure, but the fact that they looked at it, and are still looking at it, makes it a success.” What the reaction to Frazier&#8217;s poster, and the process behind its making, point to is the surprisingly <em>transparent</em> nature of graphic design — the extent to which the creator&#8217;s subjective experience in making a piece bleeds over into the observer&#8217;s reaction to it.</p><p>Creative solutions that take no searching on the part of the designer rarely make a mark on the audience either. If the designer is willing to set out in a direction whose end point is not immediately apparent, on the other hand, the journey taken is relayed back to the viewer in the split second of perception, and this experience of <em>distance</em> — of having a message relayed to us in terms that are clear and yet outside the ordinary — can make the experience of seeing memorable. In the next section, we will look at another work whose dramatic impact derives from the fact that its author moved beyond his immediate first impressions in order to create it.</p><h3>Exhibit C: Art Spiegelman</h3><p>Best known as the creator of the acclaimed graphic novel <em>Maus, </em>Art Spiegelman was working as a staff artist for the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine on September 11th,  2001. A resident of downtown Manhattan, he lived a short distance from Ground Zero and was grappling with the day&#8217;s events when a call came through from the <em>New Yorker</em> office explaining that, incredibly, the magazine would be putting out a special issue at the end of the week and needed a cover from him as soon as possible.</p><p>Settling down to a daunting task, Spiegelman started out by painting his most immediate visceral impressions of the day: the vivid blue sky that hung over New York on that day and its incongruity with the smoke, ruin and destruction that had transpired. After a while, he had created an illustration that looked something like this:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/110-stories.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89217" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/110-stories.jpg" alt="110-stories in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="264" height="475" /></a></p><p>We know what this image looked like because Spiegelman later used it for the cover for an anthology of writing about the September 11th attacks called <em>110 Stories</em>. But, for his magazine cover, Spiegelman rejected this direction. Why? “I was barking up the wrong tree,” he later told <em>The Progressive </em>magazine: “It had a blue sky and orange building; it was channeling [René] Magritte, with the thought bubble, &#8216;It&#8217;s such a nice day, what a bummer.&#8217; It was a reasonable cover for a book that came out a year later, but it just wasn&#8217;t sufficient, because anything with a nice blue sky and pretty orange building was just too pretty. And pretty outweighed whatever meanings those shrouds had.”</p><p>Spiegelman&#8217;s use of blue sky here isn’t a cliché in the conventional sense&#8230; but in the context of his design process, it was functioning in much the same way that a cliché does: a too-readily-available impression that speaks too literally to its audience and thereby dulls the piece’s potential emotional charge.</p><p>Rather than trashing his canvas and starting from scratch, however, <strong>Spiegelman simply responded to what he didn&#8217;t like: </strong> “I kept trying to gray down and dim down the image, so, OK, a less blue sky, less orange buildings. [...] Then I finally said to Francoise that it should just be a black-on-black cover because every time I was walking to my studio from my house I kept finding myself turning around to make sure the towers were not there, as though they were a kind of phantom limb&#8221;:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/spiegelman.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89218" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/spiegelman.jpg" alt="Spiegelman in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="400" height="552" /></a></p><p>What binds both Frazier and Spiegelman&#8217;s accounts together is the evidence that neither artist could have visualized his final solution from the outset of the process. Both used (perhaps it&#8217;s even fair to say <em>needed</em>) the intermediary steps of (a) identifying cliché and (b) reacting to cliché to set them in the right direction.</p><h3>Exhibit D: Ivan Chermayeff</h3><p>Our fourth example involves a case where simple associations were not so much rejected as stitched together in an imaginative manner to create a complex and engaging message.</p><p>For decades, the office of Chermayeff &amp; Geismar has managed to produce memorable images with a narrative capability, pieces that quickly tell a story in an engaging manner. One such work is Ivan Chermayeff&#8217;s poster for a television series called Between the Wars that covers the diplomatic efforts that transpired between 1914 and 1940. Even more overtly than Craig Frazier&#8217;s poster, this work deliberately presents a puzzle to the viewer, whose enjoyment of the piece lies in the process of assembling its visual clues:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/chermayeff1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89220" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/chermayeff1.jpg" alt="Chermayeff1 in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="400" height="500" /></a></p><p>The designer did not, however, set out with the intention of being clever. When I emailed Chermayeff to ask about the challenge of Between The Wars, he replied as follows: &#8220;A title which raises many questions. The process of illustrating such a title was the search for images that will immediately answer those questions. Together those images must connect as a coordinated and related whole image.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;What are possible symbols of World War I and World War II that existed and that are immediately recognized in our time?&#8221; Note that, again, the process again begins with the gathering of simple, readily-apparent associations:  &#8221;Maps, armaments, tanks, nationalities and their physical characteristics, trends, battlefields — there are many, many things. Most of them too complex to be a simple, resonating image.&#8221; In response to the problem — complexity — the designer sets out looking for its opposite, simplicity: &#8220;One thinks and searches, one looks at the available visual records of two world wars, and what comes up —Helmets!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Helmets evolved and they changed over the years. But they are always there in the photographs. Once seen, they are seized. One can hold them in one’s hand, and everyone recognizes them. So what remains to fill the gap between 1918 and 1940? What is the image of the 22 years between to match the simplicity of the two helmets at either side? Talk and discourse and ambition all surround the nations engaged in these two conflicts. The common thread is diplomacy. What is like a helmet but not a part of war? A hat! A diplomatic hat of a statesman in the twenties and thirties is the homburg, and it fits between the wars on the head just like a helmet.&#8221;</p><p>In this case<strong>, the final design does not so much refute the clichés of the field as cleverly assemble them. </strong>But the thought process behind it works in the same way: it starts with the readily-available information and works methodically, step by step, to react to what is lacking in the first sweep of associations.</p><h3>Exhibit E: Jesse Bennett-Chamberlain</h3><p>It seems to be easier to talk about idea generation in the context of print than web. A designer&#8217;s success, or lack thereof, in coming up with a good idea shows itself more plainly when the medium is something like a poster (as in the Frazier and Chermayeff examples above) or a magazine cover (Spiegelman), which are only called upon to communicate a single visual message to the onlooker. A typical web interface, in contrast, must balance a host of competing priorities — navigational, functional, hierarchical — the sum of which can frequently obscure our understanding of how successful the designer was in one particular area.</p><p>Nevertheless, <strong>web design needs fresh thinking just as much as print design</strong>, and the role played by clichés can be every bit as detrimental. Jesse Bennett-Chamberlain&#8217;s account of redesigning the <a href="http://steinway.com/">website for Steinway and Sons</a> explains how a formulaic approach to one issue (in this case, layout) can deprive the design of strength in another key area (aesthetic/emotional impact). Bennett-Chamberlain has a <a href="http://www.31three.com/notebook/archive/steinway_sons/">nice write-up of this project</a> in the Notebook section of his site, <a href="http://www.31three.com/">31three.com</a> — the following discussion is drawn from his account and from follow-up questions I posed to him by email.</p><p>Having never worked with the client before, Bennett-Chamberlain recounts that he &#8220;played it safe&#8221; in his initial process and &#8220;started off with a design that closely followed a wireframe that they provided&#8221;:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/steinway-schematic.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90684" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/steinway-schematic.png" alt="Steinway-schematic in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="510" height="380" /></a></p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/homepage-schematic-14.png"></a></p><p>This wireframe suggests a classic template for usability — &#8220;a layout that was very typical,&#8221; Bennett-Chamberlain recalls, &#8220;and reminded me mostly of Apple&#8221;. (In fact, you can see that this layout is almost exactly that of Apple&#8217;s homepage). While there is nothing necessarily wrong with following the lead of an acclaimed site like Apple&#8217;s, in this case, the boxy, conventional guidelines proposed by the client&#8217;s wireframe led to an initial design that failed to do justice to the subject matter:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/steinway1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90372" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/steinway1.jpg" alt="Steinway1 in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="510" height="411" /></a></p><p>Not a bad design, by any means&#8230; and yet if you removed Lang Lang from his piano bench and placed him inside a luxury car, this could quickly become a site for Audi or Lexus. &#8220;I thought the initial design was okay,&#8221; Bennett-Chamberlain explains, &#8220;but it still didn&#8217;t feel &#8216;Steinway&#8217; to me. It seemed a bit underdeveloped, too easy of a solution for such an elegant brand.&#8221;</p><p>Much of the problem lay with the <strong>cookie-cutter wireframe</strong>: &#8220;Although the image of Lang Lang was dynamic and had some energy, the layout of the site felt pretty linear, boxy, and well&#8230; boring.&#8221; Lost in the conventional presentation were the aspects of the grand piano that make it truly remarkable: its shape, its contours, and, of course, its sound. &#8220;I wanted the piano to be in the spotlight,&#8221; he recalls, &#8220;and not share the stage with anything else.&#8221; Bennett-Chamberlain presented a variant design that strayed a bit from the recommended wireframe by &#8220;placing the piano front and centre, and then building the site around it&#8221;:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/steinway21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90405" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/steinway21.jpg" alt="Steinway21 in Examining The Design Process: Clichés and Idea Generation" width="510" height="402" /></a></p><p>In the final iteration, Lang Lang has been reluctantly whisked off the stage, and the instrument itself is the star of the show. The piano&#8217;s distinctive contours are emphasized by the graceful arc placed behind it, and by the decision to have its lid peek up above the designated promo area into the top nav. The background motif of piano strings has been ramped up to create a semi-abstract, radial representation of sound (indeed, you can almost hear the piano in the final design).</p><p>In the nav bar area, the usual &#8216;logo left&#8217; convention has been discarded here for centered treatment that makes you feel like you&#8217;re sitting on the bench itself and gazing at the Steinway and Sons trademark sitting over middle C. Yet nothing has been lost in terms of ease-of-use compared with Bennett-Chamberlain&#8217;s original design — it simply took an effort of self-critique and problem-solving to do justice to both the functional and aesthetic possibilities of the project: &#8220;I figured that if these guys can spend a year making a single piano, I could probably spend an extra couple hours here and there on refining these details.&#8221;</p><p><strong> </strong></p><h3>Putting It Into Practice</h3><p>These works by Frazier, Spiegelman, Chermayeff and Bennett-Chamberlain are classic examples of what designers like to call &#8216;process work&#8217; or &#8216;methodology&#8217;, terms that refer to a method of drawing ideas, direction and inspiration from the <em>process</em> of working on the design itself, rather than simply having a fixed destination from the outset. No one can write step-by-step instructions on how to do this — the entire point, after all, is to react, rather than obeying fixed directives — but there are certain steps we can take at the outset of a project that help clear the way to let this process happen:</p><ul><li><strong>Start with a sketchbook, not a computer</strong>. There was a time when I once suspected that the teachers who tried to impress this point on me were just cranky technophobes&#8230; but over time, I came to appreciate the wisdom of this suggestion. The computer is a bad companion to start with because its particular toolset pushes us in certain directions (towards clearly defined shapes and hard edges) and because it tempts us to focus overly on execution (by offering up sexy drop shadows and whatnot) before our concept has really come together.</li><li>Using your sketchbook, start by drawing every association you come up with for the subject matter. <strong>Draw it quickly, and don&#8217;t be critical</strong>. At this stage, it&#8217;s not about making pretty pictures, and it&#8217;s not about evaluating your ideas (in fact, the ability to turn the critical part of your brain on and off is one of the most helpful tricks you can develop).</li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t try to avoid clichés — let them happen</strong>. Trying not to think of clichés is like the old joke where someone says &#8216;Don&#8217;t think of a pink elephant.&#8217; It&#8217;s best to get them down on paper and get them out of your system.</li><li>Once you&#8217;ve jotted down every association you can think of, take a break, come back and <strong>jot down a few more</strong>. Then, take a longer break&#8230;</li><li>Come back with fresh eyes and look at what you have in front of you. Now is the time to be critical, but also to be fair. <strong>Seeing our own work clearly for its merits</strong>, without bias and defensiveness, is one of the hardest things for graphic designers to do. George Orwell wasn&#8217;t thinking about graphic designers when he wrote, &#8220;To see clearly what is in front of one&#8217;s face requires constant struggle,&#8221; but he might as well have been.</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There is no single answer to the question of where good ideas come from. Some designs actually <em>do</em> seem to come out of thin air, like the Citibank logo that Paula Scher infamously drew on a napkin during an early meeting with the client. But a great many more good ideas come about through the incremental process described in this article, of gathering and making decisions about readily-available information.</p><p>The viability of this approach suggests that <strong>coming up with good ideas is not a matter of genius, but rather simply a challenge of seeing clearly and thinking sensibly</strong>. The good news that this implies is, idea generation is a learnable skill that can be cultivated in many of us, not just in a chosen few. The only disappointing part is that you don&#8217;t get to feel like a genius while you&#8217;re doing it.</p><p>If idea generation is a process that is accessible to everyone, then what accounts for the fact that it can be so hard to pull off? Part of the answer lies in our inability to get out of our own way, a condition which stems largely from our ideas about what it means to be a &#8216;professional&#8217;. The term &#8216;professional&#8217; is generally used to connote a person who is in control of their work process at all times&#8230; and, yet, as we&#8217;ve seen in this article, the condition of absolute control is rarely a place where exciting design comes from.</p><p>&#8220;What is required in our field, more than anything else, is the continuous transgression,&#8221; Milton Glaser writes in his wonderful essay <em>Ten Things I Have Learned</em>. &#8220;Professionalism does not allow for that because transgression has to encompass the possibility of failure and if you are professional your instinct is not to fail, it is to repeat success.&#8221; Graphic design is one of the few fields where it works to our advantage if we can let go of the reins from time to time, a feature that makes it to be an exhilarating place to work if we can manage not to find it unnerving.</p><h4>Credits</h4><p>I would like to thank <strong>Craig Frazier</strong> for his assistance in locating a copy

We’re wired to theorize. Theories make us feel secure. We can wrap our heads around them and explain them with little diagrams on whiteboards, or with equations, or even graphs. We give theories fancy names like “The Classical Elemental Theory” and “The Flat Earth Hypothesis.”</p><p> The bottom line is: we humans love theories.

I know him as the guy who ruined the world by uttering seven simple yet lethal words: “Winners never quit, and quitters never win.” You’ll find this unassuming little quotation’s fingerprints all over tragic events worldwide: co-dependent lovers who implode their relationships, leaders of warring nations who refuse to compromise for peace, CEOs who won’t back down from flawed strategies to save their company from bankruptcy, and blackjack players who double-down instead of retreating to their rooms.</p><p>Admittedly, Vince wasn’t the real offender. He was just a messenger for the real culprit: our humanness. The urge to persevere despite seemingly unconquerable conditions is as human as opposable thumbs. We’re so awful at cutting our losses that there’s even a technical term for this tendency: <a href="http://loss-aversion.behaviouralfinance.net/">loss aversion</a>. We strongly prefer to avoid losses than to achieve gains. It’s central to our inability to quit. Quitting has a bad rep, but it’s often the most rational option.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onRbNsxRBVQ"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/maguire.jpg" width="500" height="236" alt="Maguire in Five and a Half Habits of Highly Effective Designers"  /></a><br /> <em>Quitting doesn’t necessarily mean <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onRbNsxRBVQ">pulling a Jerry Maguire</a>, although it did work out well for him in the end.</em></p><p>As Seth Godin writes in a little book about quitting called <em>The Dip</em>, “Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time.” It’s worthy, practical advice that can curb the runaway idealist in every designer. Bear in mind, we’re not just talking about quitting your job. We’re talking about quitting things on a daily basis. This entails: picking your battles at work; discerning not just your design goals, but your non-goals; relenting to client needs when necessary; and trading off some design idealism for business karma.</p><p>Ironically, quitting can be good for your career. So, that’s the first habit: learn to quit. Let things go. <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2010/07/01/kill-your-darlings/">Kill your darlings.</a></p><h3>They Redesign Processes</h3><p>I remember when Agile software development methodologies were all the rage. I was working at Amazon as a program manager at the time, and our team was the first to adopt Scrum. Scrum was going to enable us to ship early, with twice the features and zero overhead (at least, that’s how we interpreted <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Project-Management-Microsoft-Professional/dp/073561993X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1272255063&amp;sr=1-1">Ken Schwaber’s words</a>).</p><p><a href="http://www.jayphilips.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/DilbertAgileProgramming.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DilbertAgileProgramming.jpg" width="500" height="175" alt="DilbertAgileProgramming in Five and a Half Habits of Highly Effective Designers"  /></a></p><p>It would have been nothing short of a miracle, but then again, most of us were fresh out of school, and miracles, free pizza and unicorns were part of our reality. In the end, we shipped almost a year behind schedule, with fewer than half of the planned features. Worse, over 75% of the team quit within 90 days of launch (which is not necessarily a bad thing, as we just learned). Yippee ki-yay!</p><p>What’s most worrisome about failures such as these, though, is that they so often occur <em>despite</em> “gold standard” processes. It happens all the time.</p><p>Tomes have been written about why our best practices fail so frequently. For a literary (even theoretical) overview, I direct you to two books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Essays-Computer-Scientist/dp/0201362988/ref=bxgy_cc_b_img_a"><em>The Design of Design</em></a> by Fred Brooks, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></a> and recipient of the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Events/News/TuringAward.html">1999 Turing Award</a>; and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Impact-Highly-Improbable/dp/1400063515"><em>The Black Swan</em></a>, by the brilliant, Larry David-like Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</p><p><a href="http://awebsitenameddesire.com"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/awnd.jpg" width="500" height="378" alt="Awnd in Five and a Half Habits of Highly Effective Designers"  /></a><br /> <em><a href="http://awebsitenameddesire.com">A Website Named Desire</a> illustrates (see the screenshot above) the non-linear and highly erratic nature of the web design process in the real world.</em></p><p>To understand such failures from a practical standpoint, we must turn to another book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1295452841&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Predictably Irrational</em></a>, by behavioral economist Dan Ariely. Ariely’s research confirms that predictable irrationality is often the root cause of process failures. Indeed, as <a href="http://awebsitenameddesire.com">A Website Named Desire</a> illustrates, our biases, prejudices, quiet agendas, irrational actions and diverse portfolio of imperfections are more often to blame than the processes themselves.</p><p>Formal processes work when we accept the irrational nature of people and make room for those imperfections. Thus, the key to successful processes lies in how <em>practically</em> we implement and execute them, not in how well we adhere to an <em>ideal</em>.</p><p>Highly effective designers embrace and learn processes — and then tweak them to work well in reality.</p><h3>They Combat Distortions Of Reality</h3><p>Picture this. You’re reviewing final comps with a set of stakeholders. After multiple iterations, you’re finally feeling great about the design. Then, out of nowhere, a senior manager says, &#8220;I think we need to change the blue on the top bar. It doesn’t feel right. I showed it to my wife, who’s pretty good at picking colors, and she felt the same way.&#8221; He continues, and then delivers the final blow: &#8220;I know you worked hard to find the right color scheme, but picking colors is pretty <em>subjective</em>, right? It’d be worth taking another pass at this.&#8221;</p><p>Groan.</p><p><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/oatmeal.jpg" width="500" height="496" alt="Oatmeal in Five and a Half Habits of Highly Effective Designers"  /></a><br /> <em><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell">“How a Web Design Goes Straight to Hell,”</a> a classic post on Matthew Inman’s &#8220;The Oatmeal&#8221;, humorously depicts distortions of reality.</em></p><p>“Design is subjective” is one among many prevailing <strong>distortions of reality</strong> — ideas that have gone unchecked for so long that they parade around as facts — in our organizations. You might recognize these other distortions: “Data and logic trump intuition,“ “Design is decoration,” and “More feedback leads to better designs.” Then there are those that hit closer to home, like “The page has a fold,” and (everyone’s personal favorite) “Make the logo bigger.” (Note that there is now <a href="http://www.netmag.co.uk/zine/discover-culture/exploding-the-myths-of-web-design">much</a> <a href="http://visitmix.com/Opinions/Designers-Be-Happy-Youre-Not-Dolphins">evidence</a> <a href="http://uxmyths.com/">out</a> <a href="http://www.uxmag.com/strategy/predictable-design">there</a> against distortions like these.)</p><p>These clichés seem benign but, in fact, are extremely harmful. They are the proverbial elephant in the room at the heart of dysfunctional organizations. Highly effective designers work to resolve these distortions in their organizations.</p><h3>They Find The Right Environment</h3><p>People are brilliant scavengers. In a world of a million choices, we know exactly where to look when we need something. We’re good at identifying environments that meet our demands, almost without thinking. We instinctively know how to find certain things (keyword: <em>certain</em>).</p><p>When it comes to finding slightly more intangible things — true love, a good job, a great employee — many of us spend a lifetime searching awkwardly and failing repeatedly. We can’t wrap our minds around such abstract pursuits. God knows we try, though; how many times have you heard someone proclaim that they have made a spreadsheet to determine a life choice or a good partner?</p><p><strong>Identifying a good work environment</strong> falls into the same category. We’re usually terrible at it. Here’s a little secret: highly effective designers are most often products of a good work environment and know how to seek them out.</p><p>What does a good work environment look like?</p><p>The answer is hidden in <a href="http://vimeo.com/9084072">a brilliant presentation on clients</a> by Michael Bierut. I recommend watching the whole thing, but if you don’t have the time, then watch the four-minute section from 13:00 to 17:00. In it, Michael answers the questions “What do I look for in a client?” and “What should I look for in a work environment?”</p><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/9084072"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bierut.jpg" width="500" height="277" alt="Bierut in Five and a Half Habits of Highly Effective Designers"  /></a><br /> <em><a href="http://vimeo.com/9084072">Michael Bierut’s presentation on clients</a> also answers the question “What should I look for in a work environment?&#8221;</em></p><p>The simple answer is <strong>trust, passion, courage and brains</strong>. Each quality has obvious benefits. In a trusting environment, stakeholders can rely on their designers’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gut-Feelings-Intelligence-Gerd-Gigerenzer/dp/0670038636">gut instincts</a>. Where there is passion, the will to make meaningful progress will flourish. Courage enables designers to take risk and bring cutting-edge designs to market. Brains — not genius, but real-world, common-sense brains — bring it all together.</p><p>All four of these qualities must exist simultaneously to make a good environment. Take one away, and the environment will eventually become dysfunctional. For instance, take away trust, and you end up <a href="http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html">testing 41 shades of blue</a> to find the right one.</p><h3>They Habitually Rewrite The Habits</h3><p>In the software industry, we strive to build “perfect” (read: bug-free) things that can’t be improved. This is a worthy goal, but it can have negative side effects. For example, we often conclude that certain practices, processes and lines of thinking have reached their zenith and can’t be modified. We start treating real life like a line of code — a meticulously crafted string, neatly concluded by a semicolon, that reaps a perfect, logical result (needless to say, I’m not referring to Web development here).</p><p>Reality — or should I say practice — proves that this kind of thinking is a mistake.</p><p>If this article were written a decade ago, it would have listed different habits. A decade from now, I expect some of the habits will have changed; for example, eventually we’ll <em>all</em> agree that “Design is subjective” is a distortion of reality. Heck, if you had written this article, you might have listed completely different habits.</p><p>Highly effective designers are aware of this. They’re always <strong>questioning, rethinking, improving and refining the dogma</strong>. Their methods are best captured by an old Chinese proverb: <em>“All things change, and we change with them.”</em></p><p>There you have it: the final habit. It’s one and a half times as important as the other habits.</p><p>Now you know what the “half” means.</p><p><em>(al)</em></p><hr /><p><small>© Nishant Kothary for <a

The main problem with such designs, however, is figuring out how to serve small images to mobile devices and tablets and large ones to desktop displays.

The simple truth: bigger link targets are easier for people to click and lead to better user experience. Make sure list items don't have padding, but links do and don't use margins, so there are no un-clickable gaps.</p><p class="showcase"><a href="http://css-tricks.com/keep-margins-out-of-link-lists/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/new-css-techniques-198.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="New-css-techniques-198 in CSS: Innovative Techniques and Practical Solutions"  /></a></p><p><a href="http://cssglobe.com/post/9435/pure-css3-post-tags">Pure CSS3 Post Tags</a><br />This is a rather simple pure CSS trick you can use to style your blog post tags, usually placed at the bottom of the posts.

It is based on the relationship between <code>:nth-child</code> and <code>:nth-last-child</code>. With the technique, the number of total rules is still O(N), but the number of selectors in every rule becomes just 2, making this trick practical for far larger numbers of children.</p><p class="showcase"><a href="http://leaverou.me/2011/01/styling-children-based-on-their-number-with-css3/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/new-css-techniques-115.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="New-css-techniques-115 in CSS: Innovative Techniques and Practical Solutions"  /></a></p><p><a href="http://perishablepress.com/press/2010/06/01/wrapping-content/">Wrapping Long URLs and Text Content with CSS</a><br />To wrap long URLs, strings of text, and other content, it's enough to apply a carefully crafted chunk of CSS code to any block-level element (e.g., perfect for <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags). Very useful for cases when code snippets need to be presented in a blog post with a fixed content width.</p><p class="showcase"><a href="http://perishablepress.com/press/2010/06/01/wrapping-content/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/new-css-techniques-165.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="New-css-techniques-165 in CSS: Innovative Techniques and Practical Solutions"  /></a></p><p><a href="http://www.venturelab.co.uk/devblog/2011/01/pure-css3-accordion/">Pure CSS(3) accordion</a><br />An interesting accordion technique that uses nothing but semantic HTML, CSS and some progressive CSS3.

Quick and useful tip.</p><p class="showcase"><a href="http://css-tricks.com/limit-html-width/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/new-css-techniques-193.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="New-css-techniques-193 in CSS: Innovative Techniques and Practical Solutions"  /></a></p><p><a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/11/15/inline-boxes-with-bottom-alignment/">Inline Boxes with Bottom Alignment</a><br />Imagine that you want to keep a "Submit" button at the bottom of a line box, aligned with form controls positioned below their label (see below). If the containing block is not wide enough for the "Submit" button to flow next to the other controls, that button must be displayed at the beginning of the next line box with minimal space above it. The article explains a solution for this problem.</p><p class="showcase"><a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/11/15/inline-boxes-with-bottom-alignment/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/css-168.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="Css-168 in CSS: Innovative Techniques and Practical Solutions"  /></a></p><p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/31/transparent-css-sprites/">Transparent CSS Sprites</a><br />The idea of the technique is to create a transparent sprite allowing the <code>background-color</code> to show through. If you are familiar with CSS Sprites, you should be able to grasp this twist relatively easily. Simply, an image with a transparent “knocked-out” transparent center is placed over a background colour. Changing the background colour changes the appearance of the element.</p><p><a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/jump-links-and-viewport-positioning/">Jump links and viewport positioning</a><br />"Using within-page links presses the jumped-to content right at the very top of the viewport. This can be a problem when using a fixed header. With a bit of hackery, there are some CSS methods to insert space between the top of the viewport and the target element within a page."</p><p class="showcase"><a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/jump-links-and-viewport-positioning/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/css-170.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="Css-170 in CSS: Innovative Techniques and Practical Solutions"  /></a></p><p><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/quick-tip-mimic-equal-columns-with-css3-gradients/">Mimic Equal Columns with CSS3 Gradients</a><br />"What happens when your main content area needs two specific background colors: one for the primary content, and another for the sidebar? If you’ve ever tried applying the background to each container itself, you’ll no doubt have realized that your layout quickly becomes fragmented as soon as the primary content section exceeds the height of the sidebar. Generally, the solution is to set a background image on the parent element, and set it to repeat vertically. However, if we get clever with CSS3 gradients, we can achieve the same effect with zero images." A nice piece by Jeffrey Way.</p><p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/double-click-in-css/">Double Click in CSS</a><br /> There has been some interesting talk about how we essentially lose the :hover pseudo class in CSS as well as mouseenter, mouseleave, and mousemove in JavaScript. Now, here is the idea: can we somehow pull off a double click with pure CSS? Yes, we can, if the input covers link, buries on focus, which triggers hover on link keeping it on top. Work on WebKit (including Mobile) and Firefox. So we've basically created a "light" alternative to hover for the sequence tap &rarr; change state / activate link &rarr; tap again to visit link.</p><p class="showcase"><a href="http://css-tricks.com/double-click-in-css/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/new-css-techniques-207.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="New-css-techniques-207 in CSS: Innovative Techniques and Practical Solutions"  /></a></p><p><a href="http://www.impressivewebs.com/center-multiple-divs/">Center Multiple DIVs with CSS</a><br />At some point, you may have a situation where you want to center multiple elements (maybe <code>&laquo;div&raquo;</code> elements, or other block elements) on a single line in a fixed-width area. Centering a single element in a fixed area is easy. Just add <code>margin: auto</code> and a fixed width to the element you want to center, and the margins will force the element to center. You can achieve something similar by taking advantage of CSS’s flexibity with “recasting” elements.</p><p class="showcase"><a href="http://www.impressivewebs.com/center-multiple-divs/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/center.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="Center in CSS: Innovative Techniques and Practical Solutions"  /></a></p><p><a href="http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css-clearing-floats-with-overflow/">Clearing Floats with Overflow</a><br />One of the common problems we face when coding with float-based layouts is that the wrapper container doesn't expand to the height of the child floating elements. The typical solution to fix this is by adding an element with clear float after the floating elements or adding a clearfix to the wrapper. But you can also use the <code>overflow</code> property to fix this problem. It's not a new trick, but still very useful.</p><p class="showcase"><a href="http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css-clearing-floats-with-overflow/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/overflow.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="Overflow in CSS: Innovative Techniques and Practical Solutions"  /></a></p><p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/different-transitions-for-hover-on-hover-off/">Different Transitions for Hover On / Hover Off</a><br />The idea of this technique is to solve an interesting problem: what about using different transition for hover on and off? In the example, when you hover over, the <code>:hover</code> transition overrides the transition set in the regular state, and that property animates. When you hover off, the transition from the regular state takes over and that property animates.

Choosing the right font, the perfect spacing and even the correct shape of text can be an important factor as to whether a project fails or succeeds. Although Illustrator is not really used for multiple-paged projects, many would agree that it is one of the most powerful applications for creating vector graphics, such as logos, and it is also often used for one-page documents, such as business cards, posters, or postcards.</p><p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/02/15/useful-typography-tips-for-adobe-illustrator/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85495" title="Inserting Glyphs" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/08_inserting-glyphs-into-text-lines.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="485" height="350" /></a></p> <iframe class="facebooklike" src="http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smashingmagazine.com%2F2011%2F02%2F15%2Fuseful-typography-tips-for-adobe-illustrator%2F&#38;layout=standard&#38;show_faces=false&#38;width=450&#38;action=like&#38;colorscheme=light&#38;height=35" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>Since we can easily transfer graphics from Illustrator to Photoshop and InDesign, designers often use Illustrator to create vector type that they can then incorporate into projects in another program. For instance, you can <strong>create a nice type design within Illustrator</strong>, then add some extra effects in Photoshop.

Choosing the right font, the perfect spacing and even the correct shape of text can be an important factor as to whether a project fails or succeeds. Although Illustrator is not really used for multiple-paged projects, many would agree that it is one of the most powerful applications for creating vector graphics, such as logos, and it is also often used for one-page documents, such as business cards, posters, or postcards.</p><p>Since we can easily transfer graphics from Illustrator to Photoshop and InDesign, designers often use Illustrator to create vector type that they can then incorporate into projects in another program. For instance, you can <strong>create a nice type design within Illustrator</strong>, then add some extra effects in Photoshop. Or you may need to design a text illustration within Illustrator to place within your brochure project in InDesign.</p><p>If you have never taken the time to explore the type side of Illustrator, you may be surprised at the powerful tools that Illustrator provides for working with type. Similar text features found in Photoshop and InDesign are also available in Illustrator &mdash; only Illustrator comes with its own unique set of typographical features as well. So for those of you who use another Adobe Suite program, you will easily catch on to Illustrator&#8217;s type idiosyncrasies.</p><p>No matter what your purpose for working with type in Illustrator is, as a designer, you will not only improve your work, but also save valuable time by knowing the different typographical tools available. Here, we will focus on some of the most important aspects of typography that every Illustrator user should know:</p><ol><li><a href="#01">Metric vs. Optical Kerning</a></li><li><a href="#02">Roman Hanging Punctuation</a></li><li><a href="#03">The Glyphs Panel</a></li><li><a href="#04">Hyphens and Dashes</a></li><li><a href="#05">Styles Panels</a></li><li><a href="#06">Placing Type on a Path</a></li><li><a href="#07">Point Type vs. Area Type</a></li><li><a href="#08">Creating Columns of Text</a></li><li><a href="#09">Text Flow Between Containers</a></li><li><a href="#10">Scaling Area Type Numerically</a></li></ol><p><a name="01"></a></p><h3>1. Metric Vs. Optical Kerning</h3><p><a href="http://www.computerarts.co.uk/tutorials/2d__and__photoshop/perfect_your_kerning_skills">Kerning</a> is an important aspect of design. It has to do with the adjustment of space between letters in order to improve the visual treatment of typography, and Illustrator provides the right kerning tools for designers. In more recent versions of Illustrator&#8217;s CS series, <strong>three automatic kerning options</strong> are available: “Auto” (also known as metric), “Optical” and “Metrics – Roman Only.” In addition, manual kerning is available. All have their place in design, but knowing which one to use when can be confusing without some basic knowledge.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/01_Kerning.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85474" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/kerning.gif" alt="Kerning in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="500" height="163" /></a></p><p><strong>Auto</strong>, or <strong>metrics</strong>, <strong>kerning</strong> is built into type using kern pairs; for instance, all PostScript fonts have kern pairs built into them. Illustrator interprets this kerning code to determine how much space to put between certain letter combinations, such as “WA,” “LA,” “To” and “Ty.”</p><p><strong>Optical kerning</strong> is also an automatic kerning option built into type but slightly different than the Auto option.  It uses the shapes of the letters to determine the space to put between characters. Optical kerning works well when combining letters of more than one font or when a font has little to no kerning built in. Use manual kerning where possible, since it provides the highest level of control. Most often, though, one would use manual kerning only in display copy, headlines, business cards and other short blocks of text.</p><p>The <strong>“Metrics – Roman Only”</strong> option, which was added into Illustrator in the CS4 version, is for Japanese typography. This option adds kerning only to Roman glyphs or any character that rotates in vertical text. Basically, it works with Latin characters, such as Basic Latin or Latin Extended, and the half-width Katakana. To switch to Optical kerning, first select the text you wish to change. Then, under the Characters palette (<code>Window</code> → <code>Type</code> → <code>Character</code>), click on the Kerning drop-down menu. Then select “Optical.”</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/02_optical-kerning.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84104" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/02_optical-kerning.jpg" alt="02 Optical-kerning in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="539" height="260" /></a></p><p>Or, if you would like to manually kern letters yourself, place the cursor between two letters, and choose a value in the Character palette:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/03_manual-kerning.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84103" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/03_manual-kerning.jpg" alt="03 Manual-kerning in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="533" height="249" /></a></p><p>To turn off kerning between selected characters, set it to “0”:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/04_turn-kerning-off.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84105" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/04_turn-kerning-off.jpg" alt="04 Turn-kerning-off in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="542" height="256" /></a></p><p>Keep in mind that to adjust the value between entire groups of letters, you will have to use the tracking settings in the Character palette. The tracking is adjusted in the drop-down menu located to the right of the Kerning drop-down menu. Hover your mouse over the menu to see “Set the tracking for the selected characters,” as in the screenshot below:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/05_tracking.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85477" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/05_tracking.jpg" alt="05 Tracking in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="530" height="264" /></a></p><p>Illustrator&#8217;s default kerning is “Auto,” so simply select this if you would like to turn it back on.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/06_auto-kerning.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85478" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/06_auto-kerning.jpg" alt="06 Auto-kerning in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="541" height="251" /></a></p><p><strong>Useful Tip:</strong> One excellent way to save yourself some time while designing is to use Illustrator&#8217;s keyboard shortcuts to change manual kerning and tracking settings. To change the kerning between two characters, simply place the cursor between the two letters. Then use <code>Alt/Option</code> + <code>left/right</code> arrow. The kerning will decrease with <code>Alt/Option</code> + <code>left</code> arrow and increase with <code>Alt/Option</code> + <code>right</code> arrow.</p><p>To change the tracking for an entire group of letters, first select the letters you want to change. As with kerning, use <code>Alt/Option</code> + <code>left</code> arrow to decrease tracking and <code>Alt/Option</code> + <code>right</code> arrow to increase tracking.</p><p><a name="02"></a></p><h3>2. Roman Hanging Punctuation</h3><p>Roman hanging punctuation will give your blocks of text a clean appearance, taking your typography from amateur to pro. But what exactly is this tool that is hardly talked about? Turning on the Roman hanging option in Illustrator will make the text line up evenly by “hanging” quotation marks in the margin. Otherwise, quotations are set flush with text, within the margin.</p><p>To turn on Roman hanging punctuation, open the Paragraph tool panel, and click on the arrow on the upper right of the box. A drop-down menu will appear in which you can choose “Roman Hanging Punctuation.”</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/07_roman-hanging-punctuation.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86125" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/07_roman-hanging-punctuation.jpg" alt="07 Roman-hanging-punctuation in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="479" height="415" /></a></p><p>Keep in mind that you can turn on or off the Roman Hanging Punctuation for entire blocks of text. Just select the blocks of text and use the same drop-down menu to change the setting.</p><p><a name="03"></a></p><h3>3. The Glyphs Panel</h3><p>Glyphs are any characters found within a font family. The Glyphs panel in Illustrator is the place to locate font objects, from normal characters to the special symbols. Whatever font you have selected when you open the glyphs panel is the menu that will be displayed. Fortunately, you do not have to keep exiting the Glyphs panel every time you would like to see the glyphs for another font or see glyphs similar to the one you&#8217;ve selected. You can also keep the Glyphs panel open while moving your cursor to different locations in the document.</p><p>To open the Glyphs Panel, go to <code>Window</code> → <code>Type</code> → <code>Glyphs</code>. Click on a glyph to select it; double-click to insert it in the line of text. Illustrator places the character wherever your blinking text cursor is located.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/08_inserting-glyphs-into-text-lines.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85495" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/08_inserting-glyphs-into-text-lines.jpg" alt="08 Inserting-glyphs-into-text-lines in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="485" height="350" /></a></p><p>Hover your mouse over glyphs to see the Unicode (the name given to each character in the Glyphs panel); the Unicode is displayed at the top of the panel. Once you have found the glyph you would like to use, simply double-click on the character to insert it into your current project.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/09_unicode.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85494" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/09_unicode.jpg" alt="09 Unicode in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="488" height="296" /></a></p><p>To see a different font, simply choose a different family and style from the drop-down boxes at the bottom of the panel.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/10_change-font.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85490" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/10_change-font.jpg" alt="10 Change-font in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="479" height="432" /></a></p><p>To see the glyphs in a larger or smaller preview display, click on the zoom in and out buttons located in the lower-right corner of the panel.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/11_zoom-in-out.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85491" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/11_zoom-in-out.jpg" alt="11 Zoom-in-out in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="487" height="317" /></a></p><p>In the “Show” menu at the top of the panel, you can limit the type of characters displayed in that font; for instance, “Oldstyle Figures.”</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/12_oldstyle-figures.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85492" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/12_oldstyle-figures.jpg" alt="12 Oldstyle-figures in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="479" height="290" /></a></p><p>You might notice that some characters in a font include an arrow in the lower-right corner of the character box in the Glyphs panel. This arrow indicates that alternate glyphs are available for this character. To access these alternates, simply click and hold the character. Drag your cursor over the alternate glyph you would like to use, and release the mouse. The glyph should now be inserted in the text.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/13_alternate-glyphs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85493" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/13_alternate-glyphs.jpg" alt="13 Alternate-glyphs in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="482" height="294" /></a></p><p><a name="04"></a></p><h3>4. Hyphens and Dashes</h3><p>One of the easiest ways to disqualify yourself as a professional designer is by using hyphens and dashes incorrectly. The rules are somewhat tedious but fairly easy to learn and remember.</p><p>A hyphen is the shortest in length and is located on the keyboard next to the “+” sign. It has three functions. It is used when a word is split at the end of a line of text. It is used to join two words together to create a compound word, such as “fun-loving dad” and “anti-American.” A hyphen is also used with two-word numbers, such as forty-two. If in doubt, look up the word in a dictionary and use a hyphen if the word is not present. Example: &#8220;Twenty-two dollars is all that your un- <em>line break</em> loving dad will give to a well-intentioned suitor.&#8221;</p><p>An en dash is the second longest in length and is used to show a span of time or a numerical range; for example, 5–9, July–September, 1:00–8:00. In the Glyphs panel in Illustrator, the en dash Unicode is <code>U+2013</code>. Example: &#8220;Our vacation is from June 13–18.&#8221;</p><p>An em dash is the longest in length of the three and is used to show a break in thought. For instance, “Down the road—and a long winding road it was—they traveled as quickly as possible.” In Illustrator, the em dash Unicode is <code>U+2014</code>. Example: &#8220;We gathered our supplies — all eight truck loads — and started slowly up the bypass.&#8221;</p><p><a name="05"></a></p><h3>5. Styles Panels</h3><p>When working with large amounts of text in Illustrator, you do not have to keep applying the same font styles manually to every heading and block of text. You can simply save your settings using the Character Styles panel or the Paragraph Styles panel. Both can be found under <code>Window</code> → <code>Type</code>.</p><p>To set a style, simply type your heading or paragraph using the font styles you want to save. Then go to <code>Window</code> → <code>Type</code> → <code>Character Styles</code>, or <code>Window</code> → <code>Type</code> → <code>Paragraph</code> Styles. A Styles panel box will appear, and in the upper-right corner will be a small arrow, which is the Styles menu. To create your own name for the style, choose “New Character” or “Paragraph Style,” type a name, and click OK.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/15_new-character-style.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86126" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/15_new-character-style.jpg" alt="15 New-character-style in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="580" height="426" /></a></p><p>When you would like to add your new Character or Paragraph Style to text, select the text. Then click on the style that you created in the Style panel box. The style you saved will now be added to the text.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/15_new-character-style.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86128" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/15_new-character-style.jpg" alt="15 New-character-style in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="580" height="426" /></a></p><p>To edit a style, click on the style in the panel box, then click to the Character and Paragraph Style options in the drop-down menu, or simply double-click on the style you want to change.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/17_select-character-style-options.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86129" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/17_select-character-style-options.jpg" alt="17 Select-character-style-options in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="586" height="426" /></a></p><p>Now on the left side of the dialog box that pops open, click on a formatting category. Make the changes you need, click OK, and all text that you&#8217;ve applied to this style will be changed. Keep in mind that if text is selected, the changes will be made to it only. Click on the Selection tool and then click anywhere on the work desk to make sure that text is not selected before attempting to change the style of all text.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/18_make-character-style-changes.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86130" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/character-style.gif" alt="Character-style in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="500" height="359" /></a></p><p>To delete a style, select it in the Character or Paragraph Styles panel. Then click the “Delete” button in the bottom-right corner of the panel. Or just drag the style onto the “Delete” button. The formatting of text associated with this style will not change, but a style will no longer be applied to this text.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/19_delete-character-style.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86131" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/19_delete-character-style.jpg" alt="19 Delete-character-style in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="574" height="217" /></a></p><p><a name="06"></a></p><h3>6. Placing Type On a Path</h3><p>Most Illustrator users know that type can be placed on a path to create shaped text or text that wraps around an object. The technique for applying text to a path is different depending on the path, though. Type can be placed on either an open path, which is a line with a beginning and end, or a closed path, such as a circle or square.</p><h4>Open Paths</h4><p>To place type on an open path (i.e. a line with a beginning and end), begin by creating a path, such as a curved line. Make sure to select the Type tool, and then move your cursor over the path until the cursor changes to a Type on a Path icon, which has a line through it.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/20_type-on-a-path-cursor.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85497" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/20_type-on-a-path-cursor.jpg" alt="20 Type-on-a-path-cursor in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="466" height="369" /></a></p><p>Then just click on the path, and you will have created a Path Type object. The Stroke objects will be gone, and a blinking cursor will appear in which you can type your message.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/21_type-on-open-path.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85498" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/21_type-on-open-path.jpg" alt="21 Type-on-open-path in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="479" height="393" /></a></p><p>To make any changes to your open path type, choose the Selection tool and click on the path. In and out ports (small white boxes) will appear at either end of the path and a line in the center and on the far left and right. Basically, Illustrator is now treating the path as it would area type. Drag one of the lines to make the text path shorter or longer; make sure that your cursor is an arrow with a line-and-arrow symbol next to it.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/22_handles-for-type-on-a-path.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85499" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/22_handles-for-type-on-a-path.jpg" alt="22 Handles-for-type-on-a-path in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="477" height="397" /></a></p><p>You can change the actual type just as you would any other area type, including by changing the font size. Doing this, though, may make the text extend outside of the area type’s boundaries. If this happens, a red plus sign will appear.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/23_type-on-path-plus-sign.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85500" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/23_type-on-path-plus-sign.jpg" alt="23 Type-on-path-plus-sign in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="469" height="377" /></a></p><p>If you click on the plus sign, the cursor will change to a linked container cursor (it looks like a text box). Then, click on another area in your project to create another open path line of the same size and shape as your first. New text will continue to flow onto this new line.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/24_new-open-path-container.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85501" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/24_new-open-path-container.jpg" alt="24 New-open-path-container in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="518" height="489" /></a></p><p>Or simply drag the beginning and end lines to make text fit on the path:</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/25_extend-open-path-text-line.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85503" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/25_extend-open-path-text-line.jpg" alt="25 Extend-open-path-text-line in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="476" height="392" /></a></p><p>Make changes to the actual path that the text sits on by choosing the Direct Selection tool and then clicking on the path. You can now lengthen or shorten the path or change the shape, just as you would with any other path.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/26_change-path-shape.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85504" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/26_change-path-shape.jpg" alt="26 Change-path-shape in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="509" height="653" /></a></p><p>You can also move the type to sit underneath the path by dragging the center line to the opposite side of the path. Or go to <code>Type</code> → <code>Type on a Path</code> → <code>Type on a Path Options</code>. In the box that appears, check the “Flip” box and click OK.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/27_move-type-underneath-path.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85505" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/27_move-type-underneath-path.jpg" alt="27 Move-type-underneath-path in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="516" height="232" /></a></p><p>To flip type over, go to <code>Type</code> → <code>Type on a Path</code> → <code>Type on a Path Options</code>. Select the Flip box and then select “Ascender” in the “Align to Path” menu. Other changes can be made in this dialog box as well: change the effect, choose other path alignment options or adjust the spacing.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/28_flip-type-on-open-path.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85506" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/28_flip-type-on-open-path.jpg" alt="28 Flip-type-on-open-path in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="540" height="405" /></a></p><h4>Closed Paths</h4><p>The confusing part of placing type on a closed path is that the start and end points are in the same place. With an open path, your starting point is wherever you click with the Type tool to create a Path Type object, and the end point is the end of the path. On a closed path, both the start and end points are wherever you click, because the object creates a continuous line. The center line on a closed path, such as a circle, would then be at the bottom of the circle if your start point is at the top. To place type on a closed path, you will have to choose the Type on a Path tool by clicking on the Type tool and dragging to pull out the Type menu.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/29_Type-on-a-path-tool.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86045" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/29_Type-on-a-path-tool.jpg" alt="29 Type-on-a-path-tool in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="495" height="460" /></a></p><p>Then click on the path where you would like the text to start and begin typing. Once again, make sure the cursor changes to the Type on a Path symbol.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/30_type-on-a-closed-path.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86047" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/30_type-on-a-closed-path.jpg" alt="30 Type-on-a-closed-path in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="408" height="383" /></a></p><p>Just as with an open path, you can change the location of the start and end points and, therefore, move the location of the text on the object.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/31_move-closed-type.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86055" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/31_move-closed-type.jpg" alt="31 Move-closed-type in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="388" height="380" /></a></p><p>You can also move type underneath the line or flip type over the same way as you would with open type. Simply go to <code>Type</code> → <code>Type on a Path</code> → <code>Type on a Path Options</code>, and change the settings to get the desired effect. Or you can make changes by dragging the center line.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/32_flip-type-on-closed-path.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86061" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/32_flip-type-on-closed-path.jpg" alt="32 Flip-type-on-closed-path in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="345" height="341" /></a></p><p><a name="07"></a></p><h3>7. Point Type vs. Area Type</h3><p>Point type, created by selecting the Type tool, is so called because it adds text to a certain point in an image. Area type, created by selecting the Area Type tool, adds text to fill a specified area of an image.</p><p>Point type is often used for headlines and other single lines of text. The more you type, the longer the text line becomes. To move text to another line, you must manually press Enter or Return on the keyboard. Area type is used for paragraphs of text and is surrounded by a bounding box. As you type, the text automatically flows to fill the box. The bounding box in area type will have two large boxes, called ports, in addition to the normal bounding box handles. These ports are the in and out boxes from which text flows between area type containers.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/33_point-and-area-type.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86066" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/33_point-and-area-type.jpg" alt="33 Point-and-area-type in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="545" height="222" /></a></p><p>When selecting point type with the Selection tool and if you have selected “Show Bounding Box” in the View drop-down menu, a bounding box will appear surrounding the text. However, when changing the shape or size of the bounding box with point type, the text will become distorted because no shape is holding the text. On the other hand, changing the size or shape of area text will simply change the way the text fills the bounding box.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/34_changing-shape-of-point-and-area-type.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84125" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/34_changing-shape-of-point-and-area-type.jpg" alt="34 Changing-shape-of-point-and-area-type in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="548" height="262" /></a></p><p><a name="08"></a></p><h3>8. Creating Columns of Text</h3><p>Any area type can easily be divided into columns, or even rows, whenever needed. First, create the area type, and then select it. Go to <code>Type</code> → <code>Area Type Options</code>. In the box that appears, you will see options for changing the settings of both rows and columns, as well as for resizing the area type.</p><p>Change the number of rows or columns by changing the Number settings underneath the Row or Column settings. The “Span” changes the width of individual rows or columns, and the “Gutter” changes the distance between each row or column.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/35_columns.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86080" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/35_columns.jpg" alt="35 Columns in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="541" height="564" /></a></p><p>If you select the “Fixed” box, then you can resize the area, and the number of rows or columns will change, not their width.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/36_fixed-box-selected.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86085" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/36_fixed-box-selected.jpg" alt="36 Fixed-box-selected in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="631" height="519" /></a></p><p>With the Fixed box deselected, the size of the rows and columns will increase or decrease when resizing, but the number of rows or columns will remain the same.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/37_fixed-box-deselected.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86093" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/37_fixed-box-deselected.jpg" alt="37 Fixed-box-deselected in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="643" height="516" /></a></p><p>If you break the text into both columns and rows, rather than just one or the other, then you will want to choose the way text flows between columns and rows in the Options section. Selecting “By Rows” will cause the text to be read from left to right, first in the top row and then in the bottom row. Selecting “By Columns” will cause the text to be read left to right, first in the left column and then in the right column.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/38_text-flow.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84127" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/38_text-flow.jpg" alt="38 Text-flow in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="538" height="579" /></a></p><p><a name="09"></a></p><h3>9. Text Flow Between Containers</h3><p>With certain projects, you may need to make text flow from one area type container to the next. For instance, you may have created an area type frame in the exact size you need, but as you type, the text “overflows,” which Illustrator alerts you about with a red box with a plus sign inside.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/39_text-overflow.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84128" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/39_text-overflow.jpg" alt="39 Text-overflow in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="576" height="108" /></a></p><p>Clicking on this plus sign with the Direct Selection tool will change your cursor to the linked container symbol.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/40_click-on-plus-sign.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86096" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/40_click-on-plus-sign.jpg" alt="40 Click-on-plus-sign in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="576" height="108" /></a></p><p>Click again on the artboard and Illustrator will create a new container of the exact same size as the first. Text will now continue to “flow” from the previous container into this new one.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/41_new-container-same-size.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84129" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/41_new-container-same-size.jpg" alt="41 New-container-same-size in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="455" height="134" /></a></p><p>If you would like to create a container of different proportions, though, then click and drag on the artboard until the container is the size you desire.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/42_new-container-different-size.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86099" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/42_new-container-different-size.jpg" alt="42 New-container-different-size in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="467" height="232" /></a></p><p><a name="10"></a></p><h3>10. Scaling Area Type Numerically</h3><p>Instead of resizing an area type bounding box by using the handles, you can scale it numerically, making for a more accurate size that can be repeated. Go to <code>Type</code> → <code>Area Type Options</code>, and enter the size of box you need.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/43_scale-with-area-type-options.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84131" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/43_scale-with-area-type-options.jpg" alt="43 Scale-with-area-type-options in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="562" height="585" /></a></p><p>Or you can go to <code>Object</code> → <code>Transform</code> → <code>Scale</code> to size a bounding box numerically. Keep in mind that these techniques will also change the scale of the text. To keep text the same while changing the box only, click on a side of the frame using the Direct Selection tool, and then scale the bounding box. The text should remain the same while the size of the bounding box changes.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/44_scale-with-transform.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86134" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/44_scale-with-transform.jpg" alt="44 Scale-with-transform in Useful Typography Tips For Adobe Illustrator" width="568" height="321" /></a></p><h3>Type Tool Shortcuts</h3><p>Keyboard shortcuts will make your work in Adobe Illustrator go that much faster. Memorize each of the following to improve your workflow:</p><ul><li><code>Shift</code> + <code>Control/Command</code> + <code>O</code> : Create outlines.</li><li><code>Alt</code> + <code>Control/Command</code> + <code>I</code> : Show or hide hidden characters.</li><li><code>T</code> : This way you can select the Type tool faster.</li><li><code>Control/Command</code> + <code>T</code> : Show or hide the Character panel.</li><li><code>Shift</code> + <code>Control/Command</code> + <code>T</code> : Show or hide the Tabs panel.</li><li><code>Alt</code> + <code>Control/Command</code> + <code>T</code> : Show or hide the Paragraph panel.</li><li><code>Alt</code> + <code>Shift</code> + <code>Control/Command</code> + <code>T</code> : Show or hide the Open Type panel.</li><li><code>Shift</code> : Hold down while the Type tool is selected to switch between horizontal and vertical text.</li><li><code>Escape</code> : Press while typing to escape from the type object. The Selection tool and type object will also be selected.</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that these are only type tool shortcuts and commands.

While these techniques are powerful and can deliver a lot of power to your pages, you need to test them thoroughly in the browsers of the day to make sure you didn&#8217;t just accidentally make the page completely unreadable in older browsers.</p><h4>Styling HTML 5</h4><p>Styling HTML 5 is really no different than styling HTML 4. There are a bunch of new elements, but styling them is basically the same as styling any other element. They generate the same boxes as any other <code>div</code>, <code>span</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>a</code>, or what have you.</p><p>The HTML 5 specification is still being worked on as of this writing, so this may change a bit over time, but the following declarations may be of use to older browsers that don&#8217;t know quite what to do with the new elements.</p><pre class="brush: css">
article, aside, canvas, details, embed, figcaption, figure, footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, section, summary {
	display: block;
}
command, datalist, keygen, mark, meter, progress, rp, rt, ruby, time, wbr {
	display: inline;
}
</pre><p>You may have noticed that I left out two fairly important new elements: <code>audio</code> and <code>video</code>. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s hard to know exactly how to treat them. Block? Inline? All depends on how you plan to use them. Anyway, you can place them in the declaration that makes the most sense to you.</p><p>But what about really old browsers, like IE6? (Note I said &#8220;old,&#8221; not &#8220;unused.&#8221; In an interesting subversion of popular culture, browser popularity has very little to do with age.) For those, you need to use a bit of JavaScript in order to get the browser to recognize them and therefore be able to style them. There’s a <a href="http://remysharp.com/downloads/html5.js">nice little script</a> that auto-forces old versions of IE to play nicely with HTML 5 elements. If you’re going to use and style them, you should definitely grab that script and put it to use.</p><p>Once you&#8217;ve gotten your browser ducks in a row and quacking &#8220;The Threepenny Opera,&#8221; you can get down to styling. Remember: There’s really nothing new about styling with these new elements. For example:</p><pre class="brush: css">

	float: left;
	border: 1px solid gray;
	padding: 0.25em;

Maybe your site’s user base is mostly older browsers and you’d rather stick to known quantities like HTML 4 or XHTML. Not to worry: You can have the best of both worlds with the venerable <code>class</code> attribute.</p><p>This approach was documented by Jon Tan in his <a href="http://jontangerine.com/log/2008/03/preparing-for-html5-with-semantic-class-names">article</a>. The basic idea is to use old-school elements like <code>div</code> and <code>span</code>, and add to them classes that exactly mirror the element names in HTML 5. Here’s a code example.</p><pre class="brush: css">
.figure {
	float: left;
	border: 1px solid gray;
	padding: 0.25em;
	margin: 0 0 1.5em 1em;
}
.figcaption {
	text-align: center;

}
</pre><pre class="brush: xml">
<div class="figure">
    &lt;img src="spring.jpg" alt="A small child with twin pigtail braids, her back to the camera, swings away from the camera on a playground swingset while the late afternoon sun peeks over the crossbar of the swingset."&gt;
    &lt;div class="figcaption"&gt;Swinging into spring.&lt;/div&gt;
</div>
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0702-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0702.jpg" alt="Fig0702 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="442" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86533" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-2: A styled HTML 4-classed figure and figure caption.</em></p><p>If you compare the styles there to those found in the preceding section, you’ll see that the only difference is that the names <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> are preceded by periods &mdash; thus marking them as class names. The markup is a little different, of course, though it’s the same basic structure.</p><p>The advantage of this approach is that if you have these styles in place at the point when you decide you can convert to HTML 5, then all you need to do is change your markup to use HTML 5 elements instead of classed <code>div</code>s and then strip off the periods to turn the class selectors into element selectors. That’s it. Easy as cake!</p><h4>Media Queries</h4><p>This could honestly be its own article, or possibly even its own book. Thus, what follows will necessarily be just a brief taste of the possibilities. You should definitely follow up with more research, because in a lot of ways this is the future of Web styling.</p><p>The point of media queries is to set up conditional blocks of styles that will apply in different media environments. For example, you could write one set of styles for portrait displays and another for landscape displays. You might change the colors based on the bit depth of the display. You could change the font based on the pixel density of display. You might even rearrange the page’s layout depending on the width or number of pixels available in the display.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0703-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0703.jpg" alt="Fig0703 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="374" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86535" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-3: A basic three-column layout.</em></p><p>How? Consider some basic layout styles for a three-column layout:</p><pre class="brush: css">
body {
	background: #FFF;
	color: #000;
    font: small Arial, sans-serif;
}
.col {
	position: relative;
    margin: 3em 1%;
    padding: 0.5em 1.5%;
    border: 1px solid #aaa;
    border-width: 1px 1px 0 1px;
	float: right;
	width: 20%;
}
#two {
	width: 40%;
}
#footer {
	clear: both;
}
</pre><p>As nice as this might be (in a minimalist sort of way), it is likely to run into trouble on smaller—which is to say, narrower—displays. What if you could magically change to a two-column layout on such displays?</p><p>Well, you can. First, restrict the three-column layout to environments that are more than 800 pixels across. This is done by splitting the layout bits into their own declarations:</p><pre class="brush: css">
body {
	background: #fff;
	color: #000;
    font: small Arial, sans-serif;
}
.col {
	position: relative;
    margin: 3em 1%;
    padding: 0.5em 1.5%;
    border: 1px solid #aaa;
    border-width: 1px 1px 0 1px;
}
#footer {
	clear: both;
}
.col {
	float: right;
	width: 20%;
}
#two {
	width: 40%;
}
</pre><p>Then wrap those last two declarations in a media query:</p><pre class="brush: css">
@media all and (min-width: 800px) {
    .col {
    	float: right;
    	width: 20%;
    }
    #two {
    	width: 40%;
    	}
}
</pre><p>What that says is “the rules inside this curly-brace block apply in all media that have a minimum display width of 800 pixels.” Anything below that, no matter the medium, and the rules inside the block will be ignored. Note the parentheses around the <code>min-width</code> term and its value. These are necessary any time you have a term and value (which are referred to as an expression).</p><p>At this point, nothing will really change unless you shrink the browser window until it offers fewer than 800 pixels across to the document. At that point, the columns stop floating altogether.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0704-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0704.jpg" alt="Fig0704 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86536" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-4: What happens below 800 pixels.</em></p><p>What you can do at this point is write another media-query block of layout rules that apply in narrower conditions. Say you want a two-column layout between 500 and 800 pixels):</p><pre class="brush: css">
@media all and (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 799px) {
    .col {
    	float: left;
    	width: 20%;
    }
    #two {
    	float: right;
    	width: 69%;
    }
    #three {
    	clear: left;
    	margin-top: 0;
    }
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0705-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0705.jpg" alt="Fig0705 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86537" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-5: The reworked layout, which shows between 500 and 800 pixels.</em></p><p>And finally, you can apply some single-column styles for any medium with fewer than 500 pixels of display width:</p><pre class="brush: css">
@media all and (max-width: 499px) {
    #one {
    	text-align: center;
    }
    #one li {

    	list-style: none;

		border-right: 1px solid gray;
		line-height: 1.66;
	}
    #one li:last-child {
    	border-right: 0;
    }
    #three {
    	display: none;
    }
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0706-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0706.jpg" alt="Fig0706 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86538" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-6: Single-column layout, which shows below 500 pixels.</em></p><p>Note that in all these queries, layout styles are defined in relation to the display area of the browser window. More generically, they are defined in relation to the display area available to the document in any medium in which it is rendered. That means that if a printer, for example, is used to print the document and it has an available display area 784 pixels wide, then the two-column layout will be for printing.</p><p>To restrict the column shifting to screen media only, alter the queries, like so:</p><pre class="brush: css">
@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 799px) {...}
@media screen and (max-width: 499px) {...}
</pre><p>But what if you want the three-column layout used in some non-screen media, like print and TV displays? Then add in those media using commas, like so:</p><pre class="brush: css">
@media print, tv, screen and (min-width: 800px) {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 799px) {...}
@media screen and (max-width: 499px) {...}
</pre><p>The commas here act as logical ORs, so the first query reads “use these styles on print media OR TV media OR a display area on a screen medium where the display area is 800 pixels or more.”</p><p>And if you want the three-column layout used in all non-screen media? Add a statement to the first query using the not modifier saying “anything that isn’t screen.”</p><pre class="brush: css">
@media not screen, screen and (min-width: 800px) {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 799px) {...}
@media screen and (max-width: 499px) {...}
</pre><p>As before, the comma joins the two in an <code>OR</code> statement, so it reads as “anything not on a screen medium OR a display area on a screen medium where the display area is 800 pixels or more.”</p><p>There is also an <code>only</code> modifier, so that a query can say something like <code>only print</code> or <code>only screen and (color)</code>. As of this writing, <code>not</code> and <code>only</code> are the only modifiers in media queries.</p><p>You aren’t restricted to pixels for the previous queries, by the way. You can use ems, centimeters, or any other valid length unit.</p><p><em>Table 7-1: The base media query terms</em></p><table class="terms" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-collapse: collapse;"><thead><tr><td style="width: 100px">Term</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tr><td><strong>width</strong></td><td>The width of the display area (e.g., a browser window).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>height</strong></td><td>The height of the display area (e.g., a browser window).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>device-width</strong></td><td>The width of the device’s display area (e.g., a desktop monitor or mobile device display).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>device-height</strong></td><td>The height of the device’s display area.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>orientation</strong></td><td>The way the display is oriented; the two values are portrait and landscape.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>aspect-ratio</strong></td><td>The ratio of the display area’s width to its height.

Note that almost all of these terms accept min- and max- prefixes (for example, <code>device-height</code> also has <code>min-device-height</code> and <code>max-device-height</code> cousins). The exceptions are <code>orientation</code>, <code>scan</code>, and <code>grid</code>.</p><h4>Styling Occasional Children</h4><p>There are times when you may want to select every second, third, fifth, eighth, or thirteenth element in a series. The most obvious cases are list items in a long list or rows (or columns) in a table, but there are as many cases as there are combinations of elements.</p><p>Consider one of the less obvious cases. Suppose you have a lot of quotes that you want to float in a sort of grid. The usual problem in these cases is that quotes of varying length can really break up the grid.</p><p>A classic solution here is to add a class to every fourth <code>div</code> (because that is what encloses each quote) and then <code>clear</code> it. Rather than clutter up the markup with classes, though, why not select every fourth <code>div</code>?</p><pre class="brush: css">

(Similarly, <code>3n</code> would yield the series 0, 3, 6, 9, 12… .)</li><li>But there is no zeroth element; elements start with the first (that is, element number 1). So you have to add + 1 in order to select the first, fifth, ninth, and so forth elements.</li></ul><p>Yes, you read that right: the <code>:nth-child()</code> pattern starts counting from 0, but the elements start counting from 1. That’s why <code>+ 1</code> will be a feature of most <code>:nth-child()</code> selectors.</p><p>The great thing with this kind of selector is that if you want to change from selecting every fourth element to every third element, you need only change a single number.</p><pre class="brush: css">

Think of it as <code>:nth-child</code> that also skips any elements that aren’t named in the <code>:nth-child</code> selector.</p><h4>RGB Alpha Color</h4><p>Color values are probably one of the most familiar things in all of CSS; some people are to the point of being able to estimate a color’s appearance based on its hexadecimal representation. (Go on, try it: <code>#e07713</code>.) It’s not quite as common to use the <code>rgb()</code> notation for colors, but they’re still pretty popular.</p><p>In CSS 3, the <code>rgb()</code> notation is joined by <code>rgba()</code> notation. The <code>a</code> part of the value is the alpha, as in alpha channel, as in transparency. Thus you can supply a color that is partly see-through:</p><pre class="brush: xml">
.box1 {
	background: rgb(255,255,255);
}
.box2 {
	background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5);
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0717-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0717.jpg" alt="Fig0717 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="344" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86550" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-17: Boxes with opaque and translucent RGB backgrounds.</em></p><p>You can also use the percentage form of RGB color values in RGBA:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	background: rgb(100%,100%,100%);
}
.box2 {
	background: rgba(100%,100%,100%,0.5);
}
</pre><p>The alpha value is always represented as a number between 0 and 1 inclusive, with <code>0</code> meaning “no opacity at all” and 1 meaning “fully opaque.” So half-opaque (and thus half-transparent) is <code>0.5</code>. You can’t put a percentage in there for historical reasons that are too messy to get into here.</p><p>If you supply a number outside the 0 to 1 range, it will (in the words of the specification) be “clamped” to the allowed range. So if you give an alpha value of <code>4.2</code>, the browser will treat it as if you’d written <code>1</code>. Also, it isn’t clear what should happen when an alpha of <code>0</code> is used. Since the color is fully transparent, what will happen to, say, invisible text? Can you select it? If it’s used on a link, is the link clickable? Both are interesting questions with no definitive answers. So be careful.</p><p>RGBA colors can be used with any property that accepts a color value, such as <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code>. To keep older browsers from puking on themselves, it’s advisable to supply a non-alpha color before the alpha color. That would take a form like so:</p><pre class="brush: css">
{
	color: #000;
	color: rgba(0,0,0,0.75);
}
</pre><p>The older browsers see the first value and know what to do with it. Then they see the second value and don’t know what to do with it, so they ignore it. That way, at least older browsers get black text. Modern browsers, on the other hand, understand both values and thanks to the cascade, override the first with the second.</p><p>Note that <strong>there is no hexadecimal form of RGBA colors</strong>. Thus, you cannot write <code>#00000080</code> and expect half-opaque black.</p><h4>HSL and HSL Alpha Color</h4><p>A close cousin to RGBA values are the HSLA values, and an even closer cousin to them are HSL colors. These are new to CSS 3, and will be a delightful addition to many designers.</p><p>For those not familiar with HSL, the letters stand for Hue-Saturation-Lightness. Even if you didn’t know the name, you’ve probably worked with HSL colors in a color picker.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0718-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0718.jpg" alt="Fig0718 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="459" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86551" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-18: An HSL color picker.</em></p><p>The hue is represented as a unitless number corresponding to the hue angle on a color wheel. Saturation and lightness are both percentages, and alpha is (as with RGBA) a number between 0 and 1 inclusive. In practice, you can use HSL colors anywhere a color value is accepted. Consider the following rules, which create the equivalent effect.</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	background: hsl(0,0%,100%);
}
.box2 {
	background: hsla(0,0%,100%,0.5);
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0719-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0719.jpg" alt="Fig0719 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="428" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86552" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-19: Various HSL color tables.</em></p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0720-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0720.jpg" alt="Fig0720 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="330" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86553" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-20: Boxes with opaque and translucent HSL backgrounds.</em></p><p>You can do old-browser fallbacks with regular RGB values, though having to specify an RGB color and then HSL color does sort of detract from the point of using HSL in the first place. HSL allows you to get away from RGB altogether.</p><h4>Shadowy Styles</h4><p>Ah, drop shadows. Remember drop shadows? In the mid-90’s, everything had a drop shadow. Of course, back then the shadows were baked into images and constructed with tables even more tortuously convoluted than usual. Now you can relive the glory days with some fairly simple CSS. There are actually two properties available: <code>text-shadow</code> and <code>box-shadow</code>.</p><p>Take the former first. The following CSS will result:</p><pre class="brush: css">
h1 {
	text-shadow: gray 0.33em 0.25em 0.1em;
}
</pre><p>The first length (<code>0.33em</code>) indicates a horizontal offset; the second (<code>0.25em</code>), a vertical offset. The third is a blur radius, which is the degree by which the shadow is blurred. These values can use any length unit, so if you want to do all your shadow offsets and blurs in pixels, go to town. Blurs can’t be negative, but offsets can: A negative horizontal offset will push the shadow to the left, and a negative vertical offset will go upward.</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0721-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0721.jpg" alt="Fig0721 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86554" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-21: Dropping shadows from a heading.</em></p><p>You can even have multiple shadows! Of course, whether you should, is a matter of opinion.</p><pre class="brush: css">
h1 {
	text-shadow: gray 0.33em 0.25em 0.1em, -10px 4px 7px blue;
}
</pre><p>Note that the color of a shadow can come before all the lengths or after them, whichever you prefer. Note also that the CSS 3 specification says that the first shadow is “on top,” which is closest to you. Shadows after that are placed successively further away from you as you look at the page. Thus, the gray shadow is placed over the top of the blue shadow. Now to shadow boxes. It’s pretty much the same drill, only with a different property name.</p><pre class="brush: css">
h1 {
	box-shadow: gray 0.33em 0.25em 0.25em;
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0722-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0722.jpg" alt="Fig0722 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86555" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-22: A heading with multiple shadows.</em></p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0723-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0723.jpg" alt="Fig0723 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86556" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-23: Shadowing the element box of a heading.</em></p><p>Even though there’s no obvious element box for the <code>h1</code>, a shadow is generated anyway. It’s also drawn only outside the element, which means that you can’t see it behind/beneath the element, even when the element has a transparent (or, with RGBA colors, semi-transparent) background. The shadows are drawn just beyond the border edge, so you’re probably better off putting a border or a visible background (or both) on any shadowed box.</p><p>You can have more than one box shadow, just like you can with text shadows:</p><pre class="brush: css">
h1 {
	box-shadow: gray 0.33em 0.25em 0.25em, -10px 2px 6px blue;
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0724-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0724.jpg" alt="Fig0724 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86557" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-24: Multiple shadows on the element box of a heading.</em></p><p>Here’s where I have to admit a small fib: The previous examples are the ideal cases. As of this writing, they wouldn’t actually work in browsers. As of mid-2010, to make the single-shadow example work, you’d actually need to say:</p><pre class="brush: css">
h1 {
	-moz-box-shadow: gray 0.33em 0.25em 0.25em;
	-webkit-box-shadow: gray 0.33em 0.25em 0.25em;
	box-shadow: gray 0.33em 0.25em 0.25em;}
</pre><p>That will cover all modern browsers as of mid-2010. Over time, the need for the prefixed properties (<code>-moz-</code> and <code>–webkit-</code>) will fade and you’ll be able to just write the single <code>box-shadow</code> declaration. When exactly will that happen? It all depends on your design, your site’s visitors, and your own sense of comfort.</p><p>If you also want to get drop shadows on boxes in older versions of Internet Explorer, then you’ll need to add in the IE-only Shadow filter. Read <a href="http://robertnyman.com/2010/03/16/drop-shadow-with-css-for-all-web-browsers/">here</a> to find out more.</p><h4>Multiple Backgrounds</h4><p>One of the really nifty things in CSS 3 is its support for multiple background images on a given element. If you’ve ever nested multiple <code>div</code> elements just to get a bunch of background decorations to show up, this section is for you.</p><p>Take, for example, this simple set of styles and markup to present a quotation:</p><pre class="brush: css">
body {
	background: #c0ffee;
	font: 1em Georgia, serif;
	padding: 1em 5%;
}
.quotebox {
	font-size: 195%;
	padding: 80px 80px 40px;
	width: 16em;
	margin: 2em auto;
	border: 2px solid #8d7961;
	background: #fff;
}
.quotebox span {
	font-style: italic;
	font-size: smaller;
	display: block;
	margin-top: 0.5em;
	text-align: right;
}
<div class="quotebox">
One&#8217;s mind has a way of making itself up in the background, and it suddenly becomes clear what one means to do.
<span>&#8212;Arthur Christopher Benson</span>

</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0725-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0725.jpg" alt="Fig0725 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="232" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86558" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-25: Setting up the quotation’s box.</em></p><p>Now, adding a single background image is no big deal. Everyone has done it about a zillion times.</p><pre class="brush: css">
.quotebox {
	background: url(bg01.png) top left no-repeat;
	background-color: #fff;
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0726-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0726.jpg" alt="Fig0726 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="232" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86559" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-26: Adding a single background.</em></p><p>But what if you want a little quarter-wheel in every corner? Previously, you would have nested a bunch of <code>div</code>s just inside the <code>quotebox div</code>. With CSS 3, just keep adding them to the <code>background</code> declaration:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.quotebox {
      background:
             url(bg01.png) top left no-repeat,
             url(bg02.png) top right no-repeat;
      background-color: #fff;
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0727-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0727.jpg" alt="Fig0727 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="232" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86560" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-27: Applying two backgrounds to the same element.</em></p><p>Commas separate each <code>background</code> value to get multiple backgrounds:</p><pre class="brush: css">.quotebox {
background:
             url(bg01.png) top left no-repeat,
             url(bg02.png) top right no-repeat,
             url(bg03.png) bottom right no-repeat,
             url(bg04.png) bottom left no-repeat;
      background-color: #fff;
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0728-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0728.jpg" alt="Fig0728 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="232" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86561" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-28: Applying four backgrounds to a single element.</em></p><p>The effect here is extremely similar to nesting a bunch of <code>div</code>s. It’s just that with CSS 3, you don’t have to bother any more.</p><p>That similarity extends into the way background are composited together. You may have noticed that I split out the <code>background-color</code> declaration in order to have a nice flat white behind all the images. But what if you wanted to fold it into the <code>background</code> declaration? Where would you put it? After all, each of these comma-separated values sets up its own background. Put the color in the wrong place, and one or more images will be overwritten by the color.</p><p>As it turns out, the answer is the last of the values:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.quotebox {
background:
             url(bg01.png) top left no-repeat,
             url(bg02.png) top right no-repeat,
             url(bg03.png) bottom right no-repeat,
             #fff url(bg04.png) bottom left no-repeat;
}
</pre><p>That’s because the multiple background go from “highest”—that is, closest to you as you look at the page—to “lowest”—furthest away from you. If you put the color on the first background, it would sit “above” all the others.</p><p>This also means that if you want some kind of patterned background behind all the others, it needs to come last and you need to make sure to shift any background color to it.</p><pre class="brush: css">
.quotebox {
background:
             url(bg01.png) top left no-repeat,
             url(bg02.png) top right no-repeat,
             url(bg03.png) bottom right no-repeat,
             url(bg04.png) bottom left no-repeat,
             #fff url(bgparch.png) center repeat;
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0729-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0729.jpg" alt="Fig0729 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="232" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86562" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-29: One element, five backgrounds.</em></p><p>Because of the possible complexities involved, I prefer to split any default background color into its own declaration, as shown earlier. Thus I’d write the preceding as:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.quotebox {
	background:
             url(bg01.png) top left no-repeat,
             url(bg02.png) top right no-repeat,
             url(bg03.png) bottom right no-repeat,
             url(bg04.png) bottom left no-repeat,
             url(bgparch.png) center repeat;
      background-color: #fff;
}
</pre><p>When you use the separate property, the color is placed behind all the images and you don’t have to worry about shifting it around if you reorder the images or add new images to the pile.</p><p>You can comma-separate the other background properties such as <code>background-image</code>. In fact, an alternate way of writing the preceding styles would be:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.quotebox {
    background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat, no-repeat, no-repeat, repeat;
    background-image: url(bg01.png), url(bg02.png), url(bg03.png), url(bg04.png), url(bgparch.png);
    background-position: top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left, center;
    background-color: #fff;
}
</pre><p>Different format, same result. This probably looks more verbose, and in this case it really is, but not always. If you drop the parchment background, then you could simplify the first declaration quite a bit:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.quotebox {
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-image: url(bg01.png), url(bg02.png), url(bg03.png), url(bg04.png);
    background-position: top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left;
    background-color: #fff;
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0730-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0730.jpg" alt="Fig0730 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="232" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86563" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-30: Similar background, alternate syntax.</em></p><p>Given those styles, none of the background images would be repeated, because the single <code>no-repeat</code> is applied to all the backgrounds that are assigned to the element. The only reason you had to write out all the repeat values before was that the first four have one value and the fifth had another.</p><p>And if you were to write two values for background-repeat?</p><pre class="brush: css">
.quotebox {
    background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat-y;
    background-image: url(bg01.png), url(bg02.png), url(bg03.png), url(bg04.png);
    background-position: top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left;
    background-color: #fff;
}
</pre><p>In that case, the first and third images would not be repeated, whereas the second and fourth images would be repeated along the <code>y</code> axis. With three repeat values, they would be applied to the first, second, and third images, respectively, whereas the fourth image would take the first repeat value.</p><h4>2D Transforms</h4><p>If you’ve ever wanted to rotate or skew an element, border, and text and all, then this section is definitely for you. First, though, a word of warning: In order to keep things legible, this section uses the unprefixed version of the <code>transform</code> property. As of this writing, doing transforms in a browser actually would require multiple prefixed declarations, like so:</p><pre class="brush: css">
-webkit-transform: …;
-moz-transform: …;
-o-transform: …;
-ms-transform: …;
transform: …;
</pre><p>That should cease to be necessary in a year or two (I hope!) but in the meantime, keep in mind as you read through this section that it’s been boiled down to the unprefixed version for clarity.</p><p>Time to get transforming! Possibly the simplest transform to understand is rotation:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	-moz-transform: rotate(33.3deg);
}
.box2 {
	-moz-transform: rotate(-90deg);
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0731-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0731.jpg" alt="Fig0731 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86564" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-31: Rotated element boxes. The red dashes show the original placement of the elements before their rotation.</em></p><p>In a sense, transforming is a lot like relative positioning: The element is placed normally and then transformed. You can transform any element at all, and in the case of rotation can use any real-number amount of degrees, radians, or grads to specify the angle of rotation. If you’ve ever wanted to rotate your blog by e radians or 225 grads, well, now’s your chance.</p><p>As you no doubt noticed, the boxes in the preceding example were rotated around their centers. That’s because the default transformation origin is <code>50% 50%</code>, or the center of the element. You can change the origin point using <code>transform-origin</code>:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: rotate(33.3deg);
	transform-origin: bottom left;
}
.box2 {
	transform: rotate(-90deg);
	transform-origin: 75% 0;
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0732-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0732.jpg" alt="Fig0732 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86565" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-32: Elements rotated around points other than their centers.</em></p><p>Two notes: First, negative angles can be equivalent to positive angles. Thus, <code>270deg</code> is equivalent to <code>–90deg</code> in the final positioning of the element, just as <code>0deg</code> and <code>360deg</code> are the same. Second, you can specify angles greater than the apparent maximum value. If you declare <code>540deg</code>, the element’s final rotation will look exactly the same as if you’d declared <code>180deg</code> (as well as <code>–180deg</code>, <code>900deg</code>, and so on). The interim result may be different if you also apply transitions (see next section), but the final &#8220;resting&#8221; state will be equivalent.</p><p>Almost as simple as rotation is scaling. As you no doubt expect, this scales an element up or down in size, making it larger or smaller. You can do this consistently along both axes, or to a different degree along each axis:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: scale(0.5);
}
.box2 {
	transform: scale(0.75, 1.5);
}

If there are two values, the first specifies the horizontal (X) scaling, and the second, the vertical (Y) scaling. Thus, if you want to leave the horizontal axis the same and only scale on the y axis, do this:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: scale(0.5);
}
.box2 {
	transform: scale(1, 1.5);
}
</pre><p>Alternatively, you can use the scaleY() value:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: scale(0.5);
}
.box2 {
	transform: scaleY(1.5);
}
</pre><p>Along the same lines is the scaleX() value, which causes horizontal scaling without changing the vertical scaling.</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: scaleX(0.5);
}
.box2 {
	transform: scaleX(1.5);
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0734-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0734.jpg" alt="Fig0734 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86567" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-34: Two scaled elements, one scaled only on the Y axis.</em></p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0735-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0735.jpg" alt="Fig0735 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86568" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-35: Two scaled elements, one scaled only on the X axis.</em></p><p>When writing CSS yourself, it seems most convenient to just stick with <code>scale()</code> and fill in a <code>0</code> for the horizontal any time you want a purely vertical scaling. If you’re programmatically changing the scaling via DOM scripting, it might be easier to manipulate <code>scaleX()</code> and <code>scaleY()</code> directly.</p><p>As with rotation, you can affect the origin point for scaling. This allows you, for example, to cause an element to scale toward its top-left corners instead of shrink down toward its center:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: scale(0.5);
	transform-origin: top left;
}
.box2 {
	transform: scale(1.5);
	transform-origin: 100% 100%;
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0736-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0736.jpg" alt="Fig0736 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86569" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-36: Two scaled elements, each with a different scaling origin.</em></p><p>Similarly simple is translation. In this case, it isn’t changing the language from one to another, but “translating” a shape from one point to another. It’s an offset by either one or two length values.</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: translate(50px);
}
.box2 {
	transform: translate(5em,10em);
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0737-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0737.jpg" alt="Fig0737 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86570" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-37: Translated elements.</em></p><p>Again, this is very much like relative positioning. The elements are placed normally and then transformed as directed. When there’s only one length value in a <code>translate()</code> value, it specifies a horizontal movement and the vertical movement is assumed to be zero. If you just want to translate an element up or down, you have two choices. First is to simply give a length of <code>0</code> for the horizontal value.</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: translate(0,50px);
}
.box2 {
	transform: translate(5em,10em);
}
</pre><p>The other is to use the value pattern <code>translateY()</code>:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: translateY(50px);
}
.box2 {
	transform: translate(5em,10em);
}
</pre><p>There is also a <code>translateX()</code>, which does about what you’d expect: moves the element horizontally!</p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0738-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0738.jpg" alt="Fig0738 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86571" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-38: Two differently translated elements.</em></p><p>While you can declare a transform-origin in cases where you’re just translating, it doesn’t matter all that much whether you do so. After all, whether an element’s center or top-left corner is pushed 50 pixels to the right doesn’t really matter. The element will end up in the same place either way. But that’s only true if all you’re doing is translating. If you do anything else at the same time, like rotate or scale, then the origin will matter. (More on combining transforms in a bit.)</p><p>The last type of transformation, skewing, is slightly more complex, although the method of declaring it is no more difficult than you’ve seen so far.</p><p>Skewing an element distorts its shape along one or both axes:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: skew(23deg);
}
.box2 {
	transform: skew(13deg,-45deg);
}
</pre><p>If you provide only a single value for <code>skew()</code>, then there is only horizontal <code>(X) skew</code>, and no vertical <code>(Y) skew</code>. As with translations and scaling, there are <code>skewX()</code> and <code>skewY()</code> values for those times you want to explicitly skew along only one axis:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: skewX(-23deg);
}
.box2 {
	transform: skewY(45deg);
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0739-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0739.jpg" alt="Fig0739 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86572" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-39: Two skewed elements.</em></p><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0740-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0740.jpg" alt="Fig0740 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86573" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-40: Two elements, each one skewed along a different axis.</em></p><p>Here&#8217;s how skewing works: Imagine there are two bars running through the element, one along each of the X and Y axes. When you skew in the X direction, the Y axis is rotated by the skew angle. Yes, the Y (vertical) axis is the one that rotates in a <code>skewX()</code> operation. Positive angles are counterclockwise, and negative angles are clockwise. That’s why the first box in the preceding example appears to tilt rightward: The Y axis was tilted 33.3 degrees clockwise.</p><p>The same basic thing happens with <code>skewY()</code>: The X axis is tilted by the specified number of degrees, with positive angles tilting it counterclockwise and negative angles tilting clockwise.</p><p>The interesting part here is how the origin plays into it. If the origin is in the center and you provide a negative <code>skewX()</code>, then the top of the element will slide to the right of the origin point while the bottom will slide to the left. Change the origin to the bottom of the element, though, and the whole thing will tilt right from the bottom of the element.</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: skewX(-23deg);
}
.box2 {
	transform: skewY(-23deg);
	transform-origin: bottom center;
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0741-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0741.jpg" alt="Fig0741 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86574" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-41: Two skewed elements, each with a different skewing origin.</em></p><p>Similar effects happen with vertical skews.</p><p>So those are the types of transforms you can carry out. But what if you want to do more than one at a time? No problem! Just list them in the order you want them to happen.</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: translateX(50px) rotate(23deg);
}
.box2 {
	transform: scale(0.75) translate(25px,-2em);
}
</pre><p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0742-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fig0742.jpg" alt="Fig0742 in The Bright (Near) Future of CSS" width="500" height="369" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86575" /></a><br /><em>Figure 7-42: Multiple transforms in action.</em></p><p>In every case, the transforms are executed one at a time, starting with the first. This can make a significant difference. Consider the differing outcomes of the same transforms in different orders.</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: rotate(45deg) skew(-45deg);
}
.box2 {
	transform: skew(-45deg) rotate(45deg);
}
</pre><p>There is one more transformation value type to cover: <code>matrix()</code>. This value type allows you to specify a transformation matrix in six parts, the last two of which define the translation. Here’s a code example:</p><pre class="brush: css">
.box1 {
	transform: matrix(0.67,0.23,0,1,25px,10px);
}
.box2 {
	transform: matrix(1,0.13,0.42,1,0,-25px);
}
