So, the industry was impressed when PepsiCo hired you. What changes have you made thus far?</i></b></div><div><br /></div><div>Shiv Singh: I've been focusing on a few key areas over the last six months, namely:</div><div><b>*Developing a new digital media planning and buying process tied to new evaluation criteria</b>. This criteria gives more attention to digital media partners that put as much attention on digital engagement as they do on selling us impressions. We've put in place a digital scorecard system for all the brands and we're transforming our huge customer relationship management program. Key to this is figuring out how CRM and social media should work together.</div><div><br /></div><div>*<b>Setting up the right internal and external team</b>. This includes prototyping a new agency roster model that gives the best agencies more opportunities to partner with us. This model gives every agency the opportunity to bring ideas and recommendations to the table that are platform agnostic. Internally, we've restructured my team and are partnering with agencies in a way that creates more win-win scenarios.</div><div><br /></div><div>*<b>Pushing a digital innovation agenda</b> led by unique tests with FourSquare, Facebook and some publishers on the iPad platform. The FourSquare test was a first of its kind loyalty program with Vons Grocery Co. and I'm proud of the work that the team did on it.</div><div><br /></div><div>*Scaling up our social media efforts and integrating celebrity talent into what we do across digital in more organic, scalable ways. A good example is how in barely five months we've launched Pepsi Max on Facebook and overtaken its competitor in "Like" counts.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>What are your plans for 2011?</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Four things:</div><div>First is to create digital campaigns that meet each brand's unique objectives. At the end of the day we are in this business to sell products, build brand health and foster long-term brand equity. My team works in partnership with our brand teams to plan through the lens of whom the brands are and what they're trying to accomplish from a business perspective.</div><div><br /></div><div>Second, my goal is to further push a digital innovation agenda through greater linkages between owned, paid and social media, while also scaling up our mobile marketing efforts. In this world, social media is at the heart of everything that we do digitally. We have conducted some fascinating tests and will be doing much more on scale in 2011.</div><div><br /></div><div>Third is to create more systems and processes to allow us to go to market more quickly and in a more responsive, culturally relevant and results-oriented manner, leveraging key moments in time. This means improving digital scorecards, hiring more people, measuring results more effectively and reorienting the organization more around building deep engagement with consumers versus just impressions.</div><div><br /></div><div>And finally, I believe transforming the beverage organization through education is extremely important. In November we ran a Mobile Summit where we invited Dennis Crowley of FourSquare and other thought leaders to come and speak to us. We'll have more internal summits like this so that not just the digital team but many more people in the organization are at the forefront of everything digital.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>What is your digital process? How are you breeding it within such a large organization?</b></div><div><br /></div><div>We have three digital processes and not just one. What drives the three is really the time to market. To make the process work effectively requires over-communication, proving the value in the process, being nimble to changes and having a distinct point of view rooted in deep digital know-how. The best way to get team members to buy into the process is to showcase how it helps their brands achieve their business objectives more effectively and efficiently.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>You came from VivaKi and previously Razorfish. What are the advantages for a brand when hiring from an agency?</b></div><div><br /></div><div>The biggest advantage is that the brand gets somebody who's deeply connected to the industry, has a diverse perspective from &nbsp;having worked across industries and with companies of all shapes and sizes, as well as an individual who is comfortable rolling up his/her sleeves every step of the way. I'm used to being extremely close to the industry, as well as to consumers, and I bring that mindset to PepsiCo. The other benefit in hiring from the agency is that you get someone who knows how to push agencies to bring their best to the table. My team works with twelve different agencies at once and knowing their businesses helps me push them to be better partners and deliver their best work.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Some brands are still just getting into digital. What is your advice on doing this responsibly and sustainably?</b></div><div><br /></div><div>The most important advice I have would be to scale up your digital team. We're in a world that's increasingly gone digital and the sooner you have the talent, the right team structure and the vision, the better off you will be. Secondly, it is important to always remember that digital is unique in that it is a two-way medium. Don't try to slot it into the world of TV, print or radio. Treat it is as the unique beast that it is and think in terms of developing strong, global campaigns that are digital at their core. Thirdly, I'd say that you shouldn't oversell digital. It is certainly the flavor of the month but that doesn't mean it is the answer for every single marketing program. You'll lose credibility if you ram it down people's throat and it doesn't give you the results it should.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>For brands that are heavily active in digital, how do you that recommend they scale their activities?</b></div><div><br /></div><div>I know this sounds boring but most important is to put in place the right team, the right processes and the right measurement frameworks to manage success. Other than that, I'd say bring the three facets of digital--paid, owned and social--under one roof. That's extremely important. I'm lucky in that PepsiCo recognized the importance of having all facets of digital in one place and created the role in which they hired me into. I believe the only way to drive maximum value is to look at digital holistically.</div></div>

        I was invited to share my 2011 predictions with iMedia Connection. The questions were interesting in of themselves and our answers side by side tell an interesting story capturing the brand and the agency perspectives very well. Here's my response to the question what brands will be hot in 2011.<div><br /></div><blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; "><p><i>This is probably a disappointing response, but I do believe that Facebook will be even hotter in 2011. It'll evolve from being the "social utility" to a brand with which we begin and end our days. Arguably, that is already happening for many consumers. Facebook will be the internet for even more users in 2011.</i></p></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; "><p><i>Another brand that will matter in 2011 is News Corp's The Daily. It hasn't launched as of yet, but when it does, it is going to be extremely influential as the world's first iPad newspaper. Will it succeed? Time will tell, but we're certain to all learn lots from it, and it will be a hot brand.</i></p></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; "><p><i>In the physical world, I'll place my bets on Best Buy. It's taking the concept of "social brands" further than anyone else, and it is going pay more dividends for it. Every brand is going to need to follow in its footsteps.</i></p></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; "><p><i>Other brands that I think will continue to be hot are Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and SoBe. I happen to have some insider information on what those brands are planning, and I just know it is going to be mind-blowing!</i></p></span></div></blockquote><font class="Apple-style-span" face="arial, sans-serif"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 16px;">For the other thoughts on questions like which brands make the best use of new media and what will be the biggest challenge facing brands and agencies in 2011 view the <a href="http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/28160.asp">article on the iMedia Connection website</a>.</span></font>

        Here are my 10 digital marketing pet peeves that I wish would change. I strongly believe that they really need to. Do you agree? Do you have any that you'd like to add to the list?<div><br /></div><div><ol><li><b>Confusing terminology used across all facets of digital.&nbsp;</b>Early in my career as an information architect and developer, I witnessed some serious nomenclature debates. What to call the Information Architecture discipline and how to relate it to other complementary disciplines. Those debates pale in comparison by the confusion caused when Digital, Social Media and Mobile are all considered different things. They're all facets of Digital in my opinion. Period.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Metrics that are overly simplistic and overly inflated. </b>One of the powers of digital is that it is uniquely and deeply measurable in ways that other channels and platforms are just beginning to become. That's wonderful. That's a strength but it is also one that's abused. <br /><br />Please let's not club PR Earned Media impressions (fundamentally about media reach and brand mentions in mainstream media) with social media impressions (consumers mentioning brands in, with and to their own networks). They're different. Both are extremely important but they're different and need to be looked at separately.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Confusing Social Media expertise with Social Media Marketing expertise</b>. It is often too tempting to conflate these two into one as well. But you shouldn't. To be a social media expert, you need to know what social media is and need to understand the philosophies, influencer dynamics, best practices, platforms, advertising formats and landscape very well. To be a social media marketer, you also need to understand marketing and you must have a strong digital marketing frame&nbsp;to guide your thinking preferably from a pre-social media era. If you don't have the latter, don't call yourself a social media marketer.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Defining online audiences by demographics</b>. I've seen this done too much over the last few years and even now whether its agencies, publishers or brands we sometimes still think in terms of demographics only. We love to define digital audiences pretty much by their age and then maybe their gender. Somehow that seems enough to us far too often.<br /><br />With all due respect to everyone doing that out there (and I'm guilty of this too sometimes), that's that's the most simplistic form of audience, customer, segment definition and its not right. If you're not getting to&nbsp;psycho-graphics,&nbsp;behaviors, cultural values and influence&nbsp;circles for example, you're not practicing digital marketing. Sorry.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Treating digital as an extension of television and just another channel</b>. This is something else that I find irritating. Maybe too&nbsp;irritating. But I believe we sometimes all forget that digital is not just another channel that's evolving at the same pace and with the same complexities as Print, Television and Radio. It's adoption, innovation and disruption trajectory is far greater than anything else that came before. Also, the ability to talk directly to consumers and have them talk right back at you (I believe the word is interactivity!) makes it so much more the important. <br /><br />Yes, it doesn't always have the scale and can't be managed and priced as neatly as other channels or platforms but it doesn't mean it is a stepchild. We need to think about digital for what it is - unique and transformative in ways that is fundamentally changing television, print and radio! The MTV research showing that Twitter influences TV watching habits is just the most recent example of this.<br /><br /></li><li><b>The "Tell Me What I Want to Hear" ecosystem</b>. Call me crazy but we have an ecosystem that is pretty flawed. It is driven by telling anyone who's specifically one step further up in the ecosystem exactly what they want to hear and giving them metrics and proof points that are sometimes designed more for promotions than evaluating business success. As a result, we all end up living in a bubble.<br /><br />The digital publishers package their ad inventory for exactly the way the agencies want to see them versus what the agency client's need and the agencies create their media plans often more with the &nbsp;fickleness of their clients at the top of their minds than actual needs of the client business. The clients in turn become thin skinned and sometimes whimsical. No one really hears a conflicting point of view from anyone who's a peer or further downstream. You're probably thinking that this is how business works everywhere but I'd suggest that in Digital and Media we're probably too much of the "Tell Me What I Want to Hear" ecosystem.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Extreme Shiny Object Obsession</b>. Every industry and every company suffer from a bit of shiny object obsession. But in our industry, I feel largely because we're at the intersection of media and technology that obsession is taken to the extreme. We talk, think, act and &nbsp;write so much more based on what's the Shiny Object of the moment than what's moving the business needle. Maybe its our technology fascination or the impatience to change and be one step ahead of the competition but we get too easily distracted by what's round the next corner than what maybe driving our businesses today.&nbsp;<br /><br />What's the opportunity cost of this? We invariably lose sight sometimes of what matters most to our business and don't go deep enough in the big boring drivers, media platforms and technologies that are having the most meaningful impacts on our business. We sometimes prioritize fame and media attention over our businesses as a result. And it isn't good for the businesses, for our careers and our industries in the long run.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Conference Inflation and Echo Chambers</b>. I like conferences and I attend and speak at many of them in a given year. I have a lot of friends who do the same and they're great places to network, exchange notes and learn from others. But I do feel increasingly that we've gotten far too many conferences on the same subjects without enough breakthrough thinking, research or case studies to share. <br /><br />On the surface, there's nothing wrong with this but there's more to it than that. Deep group think sets in. We all begin thinking and saying exactly what we're hearing versus focusing on what we're experiencing and uncovering for ourselves. The net result - our industry as a whole doesn't innovate at the pace it probably could. I don't see too many product folks from Facebook at our industry conferences and I think they recognize that they have to filter out all the noise to do breakthrough work.<br /><br /></li><li><b>We play the competitor card far too much</b>. This one could be totally personal but it is quite amusing how media companies and technology vendors try to sell me something with the argument that our competition is using their service or is on the verge of. Sure we all make some business decisions for defensive, competitive reasons but that doesn't drive our thinking and it shouldn't. This matters to any company anywhere in the ecosystem.<br /><br />When I evaluate a partner, I want to see how his product or service will add value to my consumers and align with my marketing strategy in a cost effective manner. That's the greater priority than focusing on doing something only because our competitors might jump on it or already have.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li><li><b>We get too comfortable with the structural status quo</b>. I truly believe that for such a large and increasingly influential industry, we do not do enough to question the status quo in terms of how our industry is made up and how business flows through it. I speak to publishers all the time and for many of them the social media companies and Facebook in particular are considered an aberration in digital marketing versus a beacon of where our worlds are headed. Many publishers like to think that the 25% of all digital inventory being sold by Facebook and the increasing CPMs that they're able to get away with, are not a sign of tectonic shifts in the digital media landscape. Others don't believe that IAB ad units need to evolve and change. <br /><br />To them I say - the likes of Facebook, GroupOn, FourSquare and The Huffington Post aren't shiny objects or aberrations. In many ways they represent the future. And we should all embrace that future and evolve our own media properties, brand strategies and technology platforms for an industry that is truly transforming more quickly than any other facet of marketing.</li></ol><div>Am I missing something here? Or am I overreacting? I know the perspectives don't apply across the board but these are pet peeves that irritate me to no end. What irritates you?</div></div>

        <div>It hasn't been very long but already the world looks very different being on the corporate side here at PepsiCo partnering with many different agencies. Here are some perspectives that maybe valuable for digital (and traditional) agencies working with organizations the size of PepsiCo.</div><div><br /></div><div><ol><li><b>Digital Marketing complicates life for a marketer</b>: There is no question life was much simpler before digital marketing entered the picture. Marketers have an immense amount to worry about. And with all the facets of digital marketing thrown into the mix - a complex space only gets more complex. <br /><br />What does this mean - the way marketing organizations are structured is probably going to have to change at some point in the future. No more is it possible for a brand marketer to be able to grasp and own every facet of his or her brand. The world has changed. And anyone who keeps telling a brand marketer that it is about 360 degree marketing with paid, owned and earned media integration is over simplifying. As an agency person, recognize what we're going through and be a positive part of the complexity.<br /><br /></li><li><b>The current structure of the advertising ecosystem is not perfect</b>. There are a lot of people in the business who complain that the structural dynamics of advertising are flawed - brands to agency to publisher to consumer (notice how far the consumer is from the brand?). I believe that too. But we haven't nailed the replacement for this structure given the number of players in the ecosystem. And until we do, we'll be forced to stay with something like this. <br /><br />In the digital space, digital agencies don't like that the fact that&nbsp;they're at a significant relationship disadvantage. Brands don't like the fact that they're sometimes kept at arms length from consumers (agencies and publishers are in the middle). Digital agencies feel traditional agencies don't get it and traditional agencies can't understand why brands don't completely appreciate their digital chops.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, everyone is unhappy. That's not good. It has to change and probably only will when truly a new form of an agency rises (yes, I know there have been lots of false starts!).<br /><br /></li><li><b>Brand Marketing is indeed in a crisis</b>. You know all the hype about social media and how it is changing the fundamentals of marketing? Well, it may not be the complete picture but it is certainly having its impact. Traditional marketing tactics aren't as powerful as they once were. It is just the way it is. But the problem is that everyone in the ecosystem (or nearly everyone) don't think about changing this space. <br /><br />Here's what I mean. It is easier for an agency or a media company to sell TV advertisements or digital media impressions or traditional PR tactics than it is to sell social influence marketing or deep consumer engagement. That stuff is much harder to design, price, guarantee and market efficiently. And from a buyer perspective, it is the type of thing you can lose your job over too. No one likes it but it is the future if you want your brand to survive. Please help us get there. Take the risks and force us to.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Agencies are fabulous but they aren't that fabulous.</b> Probably the most humbling fact about moving over to the client side was the realization that agencies don't look that different from each other from afar. When you're on the agency side, you invariably drink your own cool aid. I certainly did a fair bit of drinking and I do feel that the agency I came from (Razorfish) is &nbsp;special. But differentiation between agencies is not always that clear. Everyone is reading the same trade publications, attending the same marketing conferences and seeing each other's pitches. Yes, there's a lot of group think.<br /><br />So what does that mean for an agency? Put extra effort into figuring out what makes you special. And don't think in terms of just having a special story but also tangible, proof points that make that story real. You're not that special otherwise. In fairness to the agencies, the brands may not be that special either. We may think we are the most important thing in a consumer's life but we probably aren't!<br /><br /></li><li><b>Biases drive a lot of marketing decisions.</b>. We have always known that marketing is an imperfect science. It is as much art as it is science. The reality is that biases - at every point in the ecosystem heavily influence marketing decisions. Accept it and use that to your advantage but always keep the brand's objectives in focus. Here are a few examples of how it plays out. <br /><br />A digital production shop that has grown into a digital agency will probably always emphasize content creation versus conversation management online. A marketer who has had great successes with TV advertising in the Super Bowl will always&nbsp;privilege&nbsp;that over other forms of marketing. An agency that hit a home run with one idea will be called in to do the same thing again and again even though the world may have moved on. The biases will always exist as we're human. There is no perfect company and no perfect agency either.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Ideas matter an incredible amount but help us think beyond ideas</b>. Every marketer suffers from the candy store syndrome at some point. We get so many great ideas from so many different agencies every day (I certainly do here at PepsiCo) that we can't help want more and more. More ideas to salivate over, provide feedback on and then be able to choose from. It's just&nbsp;irresistible.<br /><br />But in the long run that's a bad thing. Ideas do matter of course but they need a strong strategic frame. Without the strategic frame they are meaningless. My challenge to my agency partners is to always think about that strategic frame. What does it mean - on the marketing side we have to do a better job of explaining our strategic&nbsp;priorities&nbsp;and our long term digital strategies. Please help us stay focused. We can't get too caught up in the candy store syndrome.</li></ol><div>What do you think? Am I missing anything important? Life on the corporate side is very different but it is fascinating being in a different place in the ecosystem. And as the agency landscape evolves with new types of agencies cropping up, it is only going to get more interesting.</div></div>

What makes this especially hard to grapple with is that we're talking about a new advertising format with new measurements for it. Arguably, with over 100 million tweets and 375,000 sign ups a day and with 160 million registered users worldwide, Twitter is steadily hitting the mainstream. But will you advertise on Twitter?&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Today's <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703793804575512711786346900.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Wall Street Journal</a> covers the question and quotes me mentioning the fact that we did a buy over the summer and are trying to figure out how best to use Twitter in the future. For the record, I'm bullish on Twitter and I'm excited about partnering with them in the future. However what I'm keen to understand is how can I better target through Twitter. For example, if one of my beverage brands is trying to reach&nbsp;millennials&nbsp;just in the northeast, can I today? If I cannot geo-target (I don't believe I can even limit to the US currently) or by age etc., it becomes harder to see the ROI.</div><div><br /></div><div>Twitter is a phenomena there's no doubt about it. And without question, the executives at Twitter know the online marketing world well. I feel it is just a matter of time before they bring more sophistication to their ad products that allow for further targeting (they'll need to enter the world of cookies to do that though). What's interesting is that as Twitter brings more sophistication, they are also introducing us to totally new forms of advertising - advertising based on topics, advertising driven by the content of tweets and advertising &nbsp;measured by the amount it was shared.&nbsp;</div>

        <p>Disagreeing with <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> is liking disagreeing with Apple. You're putting your reputation at risk. But I feel obliged to take the plunge as I'm feeling a little irritated with it.</p><div>In a nutshell, I think Google Instant Search is an instant annoyance. Yes, it'll save me a precious few milliseconds and the real time&nbsp;feedback will occasionally&nbsp;improve my search querying. I'll also enjoy the fact that I don't have to press the return button on my keyboard after entering a term. But those benefits come at a significant cost that may not be immediately apparent to everyone. Here are the critical reasons why I do not like Google Instant Search.</div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><ol><li><b>Google Instant Flash.&nbsp;Too much like Times Square.&nbsp;</b>It's frightening but when I first started playing around with Google Instant Search I was reminded of all those intro flash&nbsp;animations&nbsp;that we used to see on websites a decade ago. I begin typing and the page flashes to a results screen. I add another letter and it flashes to different search results. This "Times Square feel" is too much for me. That alone is reason enough to tun it off especially if you do a lot of searches and a lot of multitasking. It is a user experience irritant and arguably something against the very principles of simplicity that Google has taught us about.&nbsp;</li><br /><li><b>Google Instant Distractions. Preventing task completion.&nbsp;</b>I use the web for entertainment but also to do some serious business. And searching on Google is a critical piece of that. I don't go to the search box to browse. I go with keyword(s) or a few questions on my mind. And then I type in my query. With Google Instant Search as I begin typing in the query I am immediately distracted from the task at hand.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here's how. Imagine I am looking to for information on "Wines of Southern France." As I start typing I see 3 search results screens flash by which have absolutely nothing to do with wines of southern France (unless you count the weather in Manhattan, Wikipedia and WinRar as being related to it). Then I get two general wine related results screens before I actually get the results screen I really want. It is hard to avoid looking at those interim results and they are useless for me. With the old Google search, I'd type in my query and the first set of results I'd see would be most applicable to me. Google Instant Search is searching for ways to distract me with this feature and it will distract me at times!</li><br /><li><b>Google Instant Long Tail Death. Hurting the long tail.&nbsp;</b>I fundamentally believe that the heart and soul of the web lies in the long tail of websites. With Google Instant Search, I'm tacitly encouraged to focus on just the first page of a search results. There's so much else to distract me before I scroll down to the bottom of a page and click the next page link. In effect, Google Instant Search&nbsp;privileges&nbsp;the largest, most trafficked and most SEO friendly on the websites at the cost of the long tail. That's not good for the long tail and nor is it for the future of the Internet.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another dimension to this issue is best expressed by <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_instant_search.php">Kevin Marks</a> who said, "The normative influence of Google just got a lot stronger" implying that what we take for granted as an assumption regarding a particular topic will be driven more by Google. We won't click further than what Google tells is most important. Scary stuff.</li></ol></div><div><div><br /></div><div>So not surprisingly, I'm going to turn off the Google Instant Search feature. Do I think most people will also turn it off? Probably not. They'll get used to it and will accept it as a default search user experience. But I do believe it'll hurt overall searching with more distractions, less engagement with the long tail of the web and a weakening of the user experience. When Google innovates I expect a lot more from them and they've let me down especially by compromising the user experience.</div></div><p></p>

It will also be expanding internationally to other regions around the world as well. The objective of Refresh Everything is simple - to help in our own way to make the world a better place by funding good ideas chosen by the community. And yes, it is a marketing initiative coming out of marketing budgets. It is designed to help the Pepsi brand and we're not hiding that fact. At the corporate level PepsiCo does other cause related marketing initiatives.<div><br /></div><div>Every month in 2011 we'll be giving out $1.3 million to wonderful ideas that people nominate and vote on just as we are doing this year. The program has been extremely successful and was recently recognized by <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/17/facebook-old-spice-farmville-pepsi-forbes-viral-marketing-cmo-network-social-media.html">Forbes magazine</a> as one of the five best social media programs ever.But we're also looking to strengthen the program further and learn from what has worked and what hasn't worked in 2010. With that in mind, we are going to be soliciting ideas on how best to strengthen the program on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pepsi">Facebook </a>starting next week. Please share your recommendations then (though feel free to add them as comments to this blog post too). It is very much in the ethos of Refresh Everything to partner with you to learn how to make the program even better and useful.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Some statistics from Pepsi Refresh Everything in 2010. We've had over 45 million votes to date with over 7,500 ideas voted on. The program gets more traffic than some of the web properties on which we'd normally consider advertising. And since the start of the program our fan base on Facebook has grown by approximately 700,000 fans. So thank you for your participation and please tell me how we can make it even better in 2011. It is worth pointing out that there's a fabulous (and large!) team that's behind this ongoing success and I'm excited to be a part of that group.</div><div><br /></div><div><b><i>Blog Post Update</i></b></div><div>This <a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/news/1732083/pepsi-re-ups-refresh-extends-project-overseas">Clickz piece</a> quotes me discussing Refresh Everything. One point that I made in that article is that the website brings in so much traffic that we've realized that we need to think about it as a media property. That this is very much an example of a a brand becoming media as the site attracts more page views than some websites that solicit us for advertising.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>What's also interesting is that while paid media has played a significant role in building awareness for the program, the most valuable awareness building and engagement has come via the grant applicants who have asked their networks to vote for their ideas. With the community serving as the media too, the program has garned greater awareness and led to more applications, more votes and more interesting winners overall.</div>

With <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/08/moving-on.html">Seth Godin announcing that he's going to ditch his traditional publisher</a> (Portfolio part of Penguin), does it mean that book publishing as we know it is dead? I find this topic especially interesting as its something that I discussed at length when I spoke at the <a href="http://www.goingsocialnow.com/2010/01/engaging-readers-in-the-digita.php">Digital Book World Conference</a>&nbsp;back in January. Here's my take.<div><br /></div><div>Seth Godin is among the most popular best selling marketing authors and his latest book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591843162/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1282653402&amp;sr=8-1">Linchpin</a> sold over 50,000 copies. The publisher probably played a big role in the editing and the distribution of that book. However, for future books Godin is planning to release them over the Internet in electronic book formats as well as in the form of apps, small digital files and even PDFs. What does this mean?</div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><ol><li><b>Seth Godin knows his readers better than his publisher does</b>. Godin has realized that he really knows his readers. He knows what they want, he knows how to reach them and he knows quite clearly what he wants to share. He has is own marketing platform via his blog and his twitter account too. He doesn't need a publisher to play that role for him. And with the Internet he can distribute his book to his readers electronically.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Seth Godin believes in the power of his brand and is betting everything on it.</b> At the most fundamental level, this is a brand play. You've got to believe in yourself and in your words if you want something to work, he'd say himself. And that's exactly what he's doing. He's putting his money where his mouth is. Will he sell as many books? Fewer? Will he reach new readers versus just his fans? Time will tell but it is an adventurous move without a doubt.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Seth Godin doesn't believe his publishers provide him enough value.</b> By saying that he's going to sell his book online and directly to his readers, Godin is basically saying that his publishers aren't providing him enough value. He appreciates the need to have a strong editor (and he's going to hire one independently) but everything else is not valuable enough for him. Publishers should be worried and so too should Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders. If other leading authors adopted this model they'd all be in trouble.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li><li><b>Seth Godin knows that the book format itself is worth a second look too.</b> There's a secret about writing books that no one likes and having just been through the process, I've witnessed it first hand. You have to fill the pages. Even if your idea and what you want to convey only needs a 100 pages, you are obligated to stretch it out into 200 or 300 pages. That's how books are made. You have to conform to those guidelines. If the book is too thin, publisher's won't be able to charge enough for it. Godin recognizes that micro-book formats as well as audio files and apps are worth exploring as mechanisms to share his ideas. That way he's not limited by the structure of the book market.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Seth Godin has figured out the economics are in his favor.</b> I'm guessing that for every book of his sold, Godin gets probably 15% in royalties. That's not bad when you're selling 50,000 books priced at $17.13. He's made $2.5 per book sold or $128,475 in total.&nbsp;<br /><br />But imagine if he sold online only where he'd probably get something closer to 80% in royalties. He'd make a whopping $685,000. Imagine if he only sold half online versus through the book chains (the distribution channels that the publisher owns), he'd still make $342,600. Or if he sold just a quarter, that would be $171,300. I don't think it is hard for him to sell 12,500 books directly. He doesn't need a publisher to be better off.</li></ol></div><div><br /></div><div>Time will tell whether other leading authors adopt a similar model. For an author, nothing is better than being able to get closer to your reader. The question is whether this model will work and whether other authors have the personal brand, the distribution platform and most importantly the courage to try something like this. I'd argue that if book publishers followed the model I outlined in this deck, they'd be less worried about what's happening around them.</div><div><br /></div>
