<p>[<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2011/01/21/meet-hotrod#hotrod">jump to video</a>]</p>

<p>Long story (not very) short? One night in 2003--after <em>killing it</em> in front of audience of about 30 lucky people in Oakland--<a href="http://www.thelongwinters.com/">The Long Winters</a> needed a place to crash, and my wife and I were happy to oblige. </p>

<p>So, they drove their Big Stinky Blue Van over the bridge, slept on our floor, and by breakfast the next morning, it'd become clear to me that I'd provided lodging to a man who was not only <em>very</em> likely a member of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokononism">karass</a>--he was also one of the smartest bullshit artists I'd ever met. </p>

<p>Almost eight years later, although I don't see him nearly as much as I'd like, I still count the guy as one of my best pals ever.</p>

<p>That's John Roderick. And, I think you need to know about him.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>John doesn't read this site--he's more of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johnroderick">a Twitter person</a>--so I don't risk feeding his astounding excess of dignity by saying he's one of the most gifted writers and <em>bon vivants</em> of our generation. He's just the best. In large part because he's congenitally incapable of suffering bullshit.</p>

<p>This was never more apparent than the Saturday morning in 2007 when we sat in my back yard and talked about a lot of stuff. Playing guitar, advertising on the web, the evil work of promoters, and why <em>everyone</em> is always trying to shortchange <em>everyone</em> on copper pipe. </p>

<p>That talking became a four-part interview I ran on the late and occasionally lamented <a href="http://www.themerlinwhow.com"><em>The Merlin Show</em></a>, and, to this day, it's one of my favorite things I've been lucky enough to post to the web.</p>

<p>So, y'know how <em>I'm</em> definitely "not for everyone?" Well, John is <em>really</em> "not for everyone."</p>

<p>He's opinionated and arrogant and undiplomatic and unironically loves Judas Priest--meaning everyone will find at least one thing not to like about him. Despite being hairy and enjoying laying on your bed, John is not exactly a teddy bear. </p>

<p>But, John's also right a lot. And, he <em>never</em> sands off the edges of his personality or opinions to make you theoretically "like" him. Which, it will come as no surprise to you, is a big reason I love the guy more than a free prime rib dinner. </p>

<p>So, why the jizzfest about that awful jerk, John Roderick?</p>

<p>Because, as I <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hotdogsladies/status/28140662654238720">noted</a> the other day on the Twitter, in <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/1">our first episode of <em>Back to Work</em></a> I misattributed a line that should have been credited to John. Which in itself is unimportant, except inasmuch as finding that link to correct the error got me watching our 50-some minutes of chatting again. I also received some at-responses and emails that reminded me how much people enjoyed our chat. </p>

<p>But, really it made me realize how much that rambling morning in my back yard <em>still</em> resonates so much with stuff I care a lot about. Independence. Agency. Directness. And, never apologizing for wanting to get paid. Also, guitars and talkative hippies.</p>

<p>So, anyway. John. </p>

<p>I edited all four parts of the video into one big (<a href="http://vimeo.com/19041249">streamable/downloadable</a>) movie that should make it way easier to watch at a sitting. Should that interest you. Which it may not. Which, as ever, is totally fine, and kind of the point.</p>

<p>But. If you like <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Dan and my new show</a> (and, seriously—God bless you magnificent bastards who helped briefly make B2W <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danbenjamin/5372867002/">the most popular podcast in the world</a> [gulp]), I think you'll really like this interview a lot too. I hope so, anyway.</p>

<p>Thus, submitted for your disapproval, permit me to present my four-year-old visit with the acerbic, opinionated, and reportedly unlikeable bullshit artist whom I respect and adore more than just about anybody. </p>

<p>Before Christ was a corporal, <a href="http://www.hivelogic.com">Dan Benjamin</a> was already a bit of a hero to me.</p>

<p>Since the early aughts&#8211;long before his insanely great <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5.tv</a> podcast network&#8211;Dan&#8217;s  <a href="http://hivelogic.com/enkoder">Hivelogic Enkoder</a> was saving us millions of spam messages. His thoughtful <a href="http://hivelogic.com/categories/tutorials">tutorials</a> on OS X (including unmissable advice on doing sane installs of <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/compiling-mysql-on-snow-leopard/">MySQL</a> and <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/compiling-ruby-rubygems-and-rails-on-snow-leopard/">Rails</a>, among others) are among the best on the web. His CSS has been widely stolen and reused without acknowledgment by thieves as diverse as other people and me. And his polymath posts on everything from <a href="http://hivelogic.com/categories/buddhism">Buddhism</a> to <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/the-paleo-diet-a-link-primer">The Paleo Diet</a> to how to record a &#8220;<a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/how-to-record-a-podcast-with-people-in-multiple-locations">Double-ender</a>&#8221; have shown a charming combination of curiosity and empathy that, amongst numerous other reasons, clearly makes Dan a better human than me.</p>

<p>A propos of nothing, Dan&#8217;s also the guy who conducted <a href="http://5by5.tv/pipeline/7">one of</a> (<a href="http://5by5.tv/d/a/2010/5/152/pipeline-007.mp3">mp3</a>) the three best interviews with me in which it&#8217;s been my good fortune to participate.<a href="#fn:interviews" id="fnref:interviews" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></p>

<p>Today, I&#8217;m honored to say that Dan and I are starting a thing together. </p>

<p>If it suits you, drop by <a href="http://5by5.tv/live">5by5.tv/live</a> in about 35 minutes&#8211;at Noon Eastern/9am Pacific&#8211;to find out <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/27131799607975937">what we&#8217;re up to</a>. I think it might be good. I&#8217;ll just say I&#8217;m as excited about this as I&#8217;ve been about any new project I&#8217;ve started in the past year or so.</p>

<p>Anyway. You can judge for yourself. Whether you can tolerate  me or otherwise, definitely do <em>not</em> miss the work Dan&#8217;s doing at <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5</a>. Because it really is outstanding and very polished stuff.</p>

<p>As for our thing? My own goal, to paraphrase a bit from <a href="http://5by5.tv/pipeline/7">that interview with Dan</a>, is to help you get excited, get better&#8211;and then?&#8211;<strong><em>Back to Work</em></strong>.</p>

<p>More soon. Thanks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the inaugural episode of Back to Work, Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin discuss why they’re doing this show, getting back to work instead of buying berets, the lizard brain, and compare the Shadow of the Mouse to San Francisco, and eventually get to some practical tips for removing friction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a start.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one wants to die, even people who want to go to Heaven don't want to die to get there.<br />
  <br />
  And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.<br />
  <br />
  And that is as it should be. Because death is very likely the single best invention of life.</p>
  
  <p>It's life's change agent; it clears out the old to make way for the new.<br />
  <br />
  […]<br />
  <br />
  Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice, heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--break-->

<p>None of us should ever have to face death to accept the inflexible and, too-often, <em>novel</em> sense of scarcity that it introduces.</p>

<p>In fact, it'd be great if we could each skip needing outside permission to be awesome by not waiting until the universe starts tapping its watch.</p>

<p>A simple start would involve each of us learning to care just a little more about a handful of things that simply <em>aren't allowed</em> to leave with us--whether today, tomorrow, or whenever. Because, I really believe a lot of nice things would start to happen if we also stopped waiting  to care. A whole lot of nice things.</p>

<p>If that sounds like fancy incense for hippies and children, perhaps in a way that seems frankly un-doable for someone as practical and important and immortal as yourself, then <em>go face death</em>.</p>

<p>Go get cancer. Or, go get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_porter#Later_years">crushed by a horse</a> Or, go get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King#Car_accident_and_thoughts_of_retirement">hit by a van</a>. Or, go get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Frankl#Prisoner.2C_Therapist">separated from everything you ever loved</a> forever.</p>

<p>Then, wonder no longer whether caring about the modest bit of time you have here is only for fancy people and the terminally-ill.</p>

<p>Because, the sooner you care, the better you'll make. The better you'll do. And the better you'll <em>live</em>.</p>

<p>Please don't wait. The universe won't.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>JERRY</strong>: I don't understand...I made a reservation. Do you have my reservation?<br />
  <strong>AGENT</strong>: Yes, we do. Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.<br />
  <strong>JERRY</strong>: But, the reservation keeps the car <strong><em>here</em></strong>. That's why you <em>have</em> the reservation.<br />
  <strong>AGENT</strong>: I <strong><em>know</em></strong> why we have reservations.<br />
  <strong>JERRY</strong>: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to <em>take</em> the reservation--you just don't know how to <strong><em>hold</em></strong> the reservation. And, that's really the most important part of the reservation...<strong><em>the holding</em></strong>. Anybody can just <strong>TAKE</strong> them. [grabs chaotically at air]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, how weirdly similar is that to our conflicted relationship with  <em>New Year's resolutions</em>?</p>

<p>In <em>Seinfeldspeak</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>See, you know how to <strong><em>make</em></strong> the resolution, you just don't know how to  <strong><em>keep</em></strong> the resolution. And, that's really the most important part of the resolution...<em>the keeping</em>. Anybody can just <strong>MAKE</strong> them!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oversimplified? Probably.</p>

<p>But, ask yourself. Why <em>this</em>? And, why <em>now</em>? Or, why <em>again</em>?</p>

<h2>Welcome to Resolvers Anonymous: I'm 'Merlin M.'</h2>

<p>A few years ago, I shared a handful of stories on the failures that have led to my own cynicism about the usefulness of life-inverting resolutions. Because, yeah, I've historically been a <em>big</em> resolver.</p>

<p>Here's what I said when I first suggested favoring "Fresh Starts and Modest Changes" over reinventions:</p>

<p>Five years on, I think I probably feel even more strongly about this.</p>

<p>Partly because I've watched and read and heard the cyclical lamentations of folks who decided to use superficial totems (like new calendars) as an <em>ad hoc</em> coach and prime mover. And, partly because, in my capacity as a makebelieve productivity expert, I continue to see how self-defeating it is to pretend that past can ever be less than prologue--that we can each ignore <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YesterdaysWeather">yesterday's weather</a> if we really wish hard enough for a sun-drenched day at the beach.</p>

<p>It simply doesn't work.</p>

<p>Companies that think they'll be Google for buying bagels. Writers who think they'll get published if they order a new pen. Obese people who think they'll become marathon runners if they pick up some <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/05/18/because-buying-new-running-shoes-is-more-fun-than-actually-running" title="Because buying new running shoes is more fun than actually running | 43 Folders">new running shoes</a>. And, regular old people with good hearts who continue to confuse new lives with <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/511.html" title="Thoreau: 'Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes.'">new clothes</a>.</p>

<p>Has this worked before? Can you look back on a proud legacy of successful New Year's resolutions that would suggest you're making serious progress by repeatedly making a list about fundamental life changes while slamming prosecco and wearing a pointy paper hat?</p>

<p>My bet is that most people who are seeing the kind of change and growth and improvement that sticks tend to avoid these sorts of dramatic, geometric attempts to leap blindly toward the mountain of perfection.</p>

<p>I'll go further and say that the repeated compulsion to resolve and resolve and resolve is actually a terrific marker that you're not really ready to change <em>anything</em> in a grownup and sustainable way. You probably just want another magic wand.</p>

<p>Otherwise you'd already be doing the things you've resolved to do. You'd already be living those changes. And, you'd already be seeing <em>actual</em> improvements rather than repeatedly making lists of all the ways you hope your annual hajj to the self-improvement genie will fix you.</p>

<p>Then, of course, we make things way worse by blaming everything on our pancakes.</p>

<h2>Regarding "The First Pancake Problem"</h2>

<p>Anyone who's ever made America's favorite round and flat breakfast food is familiar with the phenomenon of <em>The First Pancake</em>.</p>

<p>No matter how good a cook you are, and no matter how hard you try, the first pancake of the batch <em>always</em> sucks.</p>

<p>It comes out burnt or undercooked or weirdly shaped or just oddly inedible and aesthetically displeasing. Just ask your kids.</p>

<p>At least compared to your normal pancake--and definitely compared to the far superior second and subsequent pancakes that make the cut and get promoted to the pile destined for the breakfast table--the first one's always a disaster.</p>

<p>I'll leave it to the physicists and foodies in the gallery to develop a unified field theory on exactly why our pancake problem crops up with such unerring dependability. But I will share an orthogonal theory: you will be a <em>way</em> happier and more successful cook if you just accept that your first pancake is and always will be a universally flukey mess.</p>

<p>But, that shouldn't mean you never make another pancake.</p>

<h2>So Loud. Then, <em>So</em> Quiet.</h2>

<p>I offer all of  this because today is January 7th, gang. And, for the past week, all over the web, legions of well-intentioned and seemingly strong-willed humans have been declaring their resolved intention to make this a year of more and better metaphorical pancakes.</p>

<p>And, like clockwork--usually around today or maybe tomorrow--a huge cohort of those cooks will begin to abandon their resolve and go back to thinking <em>all</em> their pancakes have to suck. Just because that first one failed.</p>

<p>And, as is the case every year, online and off, there won't be nearly as many breathless updates to properly bookend how poorly our annual ritual of aspirational change has fared. Which is instructive.</p>

<p>Not because new year's resolutions are a universally bad idea. And, not because Change is Bad. And, not because we should be embarrassed about occasionally falling short of our own (frequently unreasonable) aspirations.</p>

<p>I suspect we tout the resolution, but whisper the failure because we blame the cook. Or, worse, fingers point toward the pancake. Instead of just admitting that the resolution itself was simply unrealistic or fundamentally foreign.</p>

<p>And, that's a shame.</p>

<h2>Remember, there's no "I" in "unreasonable"</h2>

<p>Granted, I'm merely re-repeating a point I've struggled to make (to both others <em>and</em> myself) for years now. But, it will bear repeating every January in perpetuity.</p>

<p>Resist the urge to pin the fate of things you really care about to anything that's not truly <em>yourself</em>. The "yourself" who has a real life with complicated demands. The "yourself" who's going to face a hard slog trying to fold a new life out of a fresh calendar.</p>

<p>Calendars are just paper and staples. They can't make you care. And they can't help you spin around like Diana Prince, and instantly turn into Wonder Woman. Especially, if you're not <em>already</em> a hot and magical Amazon princess.</p>

<p>First, be reasonable. Don't set yourself up for failure by demanding things  that you've never come close to achieving before. I realize this is antithetical to most self-improvement bullshit, but that's exactly the point. If you were already a viking, you wouldn't need to build a big boat. Start with where you are right now. Not with where you wish you'd been.</p>

<p>Also, accept that the first pancake will <em>always</em> suck. Hell, if you've never picked up a spatula before, be cool with the fact that your <em>first hundred</em> pancakes might suck. <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/maxfuncon-merlin-mann-doing-creative-work-sound-young-america">This is, as I've said, <em>huge</em></a>. Failure is the sound of beginning to suck a little less.</p>

<p>And, finally, also be clear about the sanity of the motivations underlying your expectations--step back to observe what's truly broken, derive a picture of incremental success that seems do-able, and <em>really resolve</em> to do whatever you can realistically <em>do</em> to actually get better. Rather than "something something I suddenly become all different."</p>

<p>At this point, you have logistical  options for both execution <em>and</em> troubleshooting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a modest plan that you can envision actually doing without upending your real life;</li>
<li>Build more sturdy scaffolding for sticking with whatever plan you've chosen; </li>
<li>Make a  practice of learning to not mind the duds--including those messed-up first pancakes;</li>
<li>Or--seriously?--just accept that you never really cared that much about making breakfast in the first place. <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/02/05/first-care">Care is not optional</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise, really, you'd never  need to <em>resolve</em> to do <strong>anything</strong>. You'd already just be cooking a lot. Instead of being all mad and depressed about not cooking.</p>

<p>But, please. All I really ask of you. <em>Don't blame the pancake</em>. It's not really the pancake's fault.</p>

<p>Like me, the pancake just wants you to be happy. This and every other new year.</p>

<p><em>Being a Parable for the Edification of Independents Seeking Independence</em></p>

<h2>THE PARABLE</h2>

<p><strong>THE OSTENSIBLE CUSTOMER</strong> enters a deli and saunters up to the counter. The deli is tended by its rakishly handsome owner, <strong>THE SANDWICH GUY</strong>.</p>

<p>"Hi," says The Sandwich Guy. "What looks good to you today?"</p>

<p>"Slow down," says The Ostensible Customer, as <strong>THE LUNCH RUSH</strong> starts trickling in. "<em>Lots</em> of delis want my business, so, first I need to really understand what you can do for me."</p>

<p>"Well," says The Sandwich Guy, "I guess I can try to do what I do for everybody here and make you a customized version of any of the 15 awesome sandwiches you see on my menu. What're you hungry for?"</p>

<p>"Easy, easy, Ricky Roma! Before I make any decisions here I'm going to  need to know a lot more about my options. Why are you so obsessed with 'what I want?'"</p>

<p><!--more-->
<!--break--></p>

<p>"Okay, sorry," says The Sandwich Guy, uneasily eyeing the growing queue of The Lunch Rush now piling up behind The Ostensible Customer. "What else can I do to help here?"</p>

<p>"That's better," says The Ostensible Customer. "Let's start by sitting down for a couple hours and going over all the ingredients you have back there."</p>

<p>The Sandwich Guy laughs congenially and hands The Ostensible Customer a menu. "Friend, I can make you whatever you want, but, if it helps, the 15 sandwiches listed here show all the ingredients--right there between the name and the price..."</p>

<p>"Whoa, whoa, whoa! <em>The price</em>?!? Already you're reaching for my wallet? Jeez, I barely just arrived."</p>

<p>The Lunch Rush is getting  restless and grumbling audibly.</p>

<p>"Well. You know. I do <em>sell sandwiches</em> for a living," says The Sandwich Guy. "Did you have a certain budget in mind for your lunch?"</p>

<p>"Oh, God, no. I'm nowhere near that point yet. I still need to learn <em>a lot</em> more about how you work, and so, obviously, I have no idea what I want to pay. Obviously."</p>

<p>"Okay," says The Sandwich Guy, "but...I can't do much for you here without knowing either what you want to eat or how much money you want to spend. You get that, right?"</p>

<p>The Ostensible Customer is miffed.</p>

<p>"Listen, here. What I 'get,' so-called Sandwich Guy, is that you're not going to rush me into some tricky lifetime sandwich commitment until I understand precisely who I'm working with. And, so far, I <em>do not</em> like what I see. Still. I intend to find out more. So, meet me in Canada tomorrow to talk about this for an hour."</p>

<p>The Lunch Rush begins waving their wallets as they lob their completed order forms at The Sandwich Guy's face.</p>

<p>"Sorry," says The Sandwich Guy. "I can't do that. How about I just make you a Reuben. It's really good, it's our most popular sandwich, and it only costs eight bucks."</p>

<p>"WHAT! EIGHT <em>DOLLARS</em>! 'Dollars' with a '<em>d</em>?' That's <em>way</em> too much!"</p>

<p>"I thought you didn't have a budget," says The Sandwich Guy.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't. And, besides, I don't really '<em>need</em>' a sandwich at all. Now, kindly fly to Canada."</p>

<p>"That's not going to happen, sir."</p>

<p>"Also," says The Ostensible Customer, "if I <em>do</em> decide to get a sandwich from you--and it's looking increasingly less likely that I will--I'll <strong>absolutely</strong> expect your deeply  discounted price to reflect the fact that I'm not particularly hungry right now."</p>

<p>The Lunch Rush begins lighting torches and chanting a guttural chant, not unlike the haunting overtone singing of Tuvan herdsmen.</p>

<p>"Look," sighs The Sandwich Guy, "it sounds like you need a little more time. Here's a free Coke and a complimentary bowl of pickles. Please have a seat, take all the time you need, then just come on up whenever you're ready to order, okay?"</p>

<p>"‘<strong>READY</strong>?!?’ TO...‘<strong>ORDER</strong>?!?’ Are you out of your <em>mind</em>?"</p>

<p>"Mmmm...apparently."</p>

<p>Presently, The Ostensible Customer turns beet-red.</p>

<p>"This is <em>an outrage</em>! I can't even imagine how you stay in business when you treat your customers like this."</p>

<p>The Lunch Rush grows silent as The Sandwich Guy slowly leans over the counter and smiles--his nose one slice of corned beef from The Ostensible Customer's nose.</p>

<p>"Sir. First off: you aren't my customer <em>yet</em>. Right now, you're just some dude holding a bowl of free pickles."</p>

<p>"Buh?" fumbled The Ostensible Customer.</p>

<p>"And, second, the way I 'stay in business' is by making great sandwiches and having as few conversations like the one we're having as possible," The Sandwich Guy coos.</p>

<p>"Because, the truth is, my <em>real</em> customers are actually all those nice people standing behind you. They're the people who buy my sandwiches with real money over and over again. I really like them, and so I give them almost all of my attention."</p>

<p>The Sandwich Guy waves at The Lunch Rush. The Lunch Rush waves back. The Ostensible Customer looks stunned.</p>

<p>"Sir," says The Sandwich Guy "enjoy your Coke and your pickles with my compliments. But, please step aside. Because right now, there's a whole bunch of hungry people trying to buy sandwiches that won't require me flying to Canada. <em>Next, please!</em>"</p>

<p>The Lunch Rush roars approval. The Ostensible Customer is still stunned. Which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>Because, several men from the back of the line spontaneously rush forward to drag The Ostensible Customer, screaming and grasping, onto the busy sidewalk outside, where they proceed to devour his flesh like those street urchins who eat Elizabeth Taylor's cousin in  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suddenly,_Last_Summer_(film)"><em>Suddenly, Last Summer</em></a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, The Sandwich Guy goes back to making sandwiches. And, The Lunch Rush goes back to eating them.</p>

<h2>THE MORAL(S)?</h2>

<ol>
<li>The Sandwich Guy can't do much for you until you're hungry enough to really want a sandwich.</li>
<li>Once you're hungry enough, you still have to pay money for the sandwich. This won't <em>not</em> come up.</li>
<li>Few people become "a good customer" without understanding both 1 and 2.</li>
<li>Few companies become "a smart business" without understanding 1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>Basing his business on an understanding of 1, 2, 3, 4, <em>and</em> 5 doesn't make The Sandwich Guy a dick; it makes him <em>a smart business</em>.</li>
<li>If you vacation with Elizabeth Taylor? Seriously. Avoid  provoking the cannibalistic rent boys. </li>
</ol>

<h2>THE HOPE</h2>

<p>Me? I just very much hope it takes you far less than <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/1476815425/two-all-beef-patties-special-sauce-et-al">15 years</a> to see and accept these sorts of things. Both as a customer <em>and</em> as a business.</p>

<p>Guys, avoid working for anyone who's not hungry enough to compensate you for your sandwich. It literally doesn't pay.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, my pals at <a href="http://Twitter.com">Twitter</a>  were kind enough to invite me in to visit with their (rapidly growing) team. The topic was <em>meetings</em>, so I used it as an opportunity to publicly premiere a talk I've been presenting to private clients over the past few months.</p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy, <a href="http://vimeo.com/15579561"><strong>Broken Meetings (and how you'll fix them)</strong></a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://i-0.us/meetings-deck"><strong>Slides</strong></a>:</p>

<p>Supplementary links and commentary forthcoming, but I wanted to go ahead and post the talk as quickly as the video was available. Special thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/mgale">Michelle</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/briggles">Jeremy</a>, and the crackerjack <a href="http://twitter.com/about/employees">Twitter crew</a> for a swell afternoon.</p>

<p>I <em>really</em> like this talk and sincerely hope you will find it useful in helping to un-break <em>your own</em> meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Last week, I pinched off one of my typically woolly emails in response to an acquaintance whom I admire. He&rsquo;s a swell guy who makes things I love, and he'd written, in part, to express concern that my recent <a href="http://www.art-bin.com/art/omodest.html" title="'A Modest Proposal For Preventing The Children of Poor People in Ireland From Being A Burden to Their Parents or Country, and For Making Them Beneficial to The Public,' By Jonathan Swift">Swift</a> <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/1169153343/only-you" title="Kung Fu Grippe: Introducing 'ū—': A Distraction-Free Writing Environment">impersonation</a> had been directed explicitly at something he'd made. Which, of course, it hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;but which, as I'll try to discuss here, strikes me as irrelevant.</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/quotes" title="Casablanca Quotes">Bogie</a>, I played it for him, so now I suppose I might as well play it for you.</p>

<!--break--></p>
<p>(n.b.: Excerpted, redacted, munged, and <em>heavily</em> expanded from my original email)</p>
<blockquote><p>There are at least a couple things that mean a lot to me that I'm still just not very good at.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make nuanced points in whatever way they need to be made; even if that ends up seeming &ldquo;un-nuanced&rdquo;</li>
<li>Never explain yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to break both these self-imposed rules privately with you here. [Editor&rsquo;s Note: <em>Um</em>.] Because, I hope to nuance the shit out of some fairly <em>un</em>-nuanced points. And, to do that, I'll also (reluctantly) need to explain myself. But, here goes.</p>
<p>First [regarding my <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/1169153343/only-you" title="Kung Fu Grippe: Introducing 'ū—': A Distraction-Free Writing Environment">goofing</a> on &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=distraction-free+writing+environment">distraction-free writing environments</a>&rdquo;] I think there are some GIANT distinctions at play here that a lot of folks may not find nearly as obvious as I do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tool Mastery vs. Productivity Pr0n</strong> &ndash; Finding and learning the right tools for your work vs solely dicking around with the options for those tools is just <em>so</em> important, but also <em>so</em> different. And, admittedly, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to contrast those differences in terms of hard &amp; fast rules that could be true for all people in all situations. But, that doesn&rsquo;t make the difference any less qualitatively special or real.<br/><br />
Similarly&hellip;</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Help Vs. &ldquo;Self&rdquo;&ndash;&ldquo;Help&rdquo;</strong> &ndash; Solving the problem that caused the problem that caused the problem that caused the symptom we eventually noticed. Huge. Arguably, peerless.</p>
<ul>
<li>Viz.: How many of us ignore the actual <em>cause</em> of our problem in favor of just reading dozens of blog posts about how to &ldquo;turbocharge&rdquo; its most superficial symptoms? Sick.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus &amp; Play</strong> &ndash; Yes, focusing on important work is, as Ford used to say, Job 1. But, that focus benefits when we maintain the durable and unapologetic sense of play that affords true creativity and fosters an emergence of context and connection that&rsquo;s usually killed by stress. BUT.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, what conceivable &ldquo;rule&rdquo; could ever serve to immutably declare that &ldquo;THIS goofing-off is critical for <a href="http://keck.ucsf.edu/~loren/Discoveries.html">hippocampal plasticity</a>&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;THAT goofing-off is just <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">dumb, distracting bullshit</a>?&rdquo;</li>
<li>
<p><em>Impossible</em>. Because drawing those kinds of distinctions is one of our most important day-to-day responsibilities. Decisions are hard, and there&rsquo;s no app or alarm gadget that can change that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although, they certainly can help mask the depth of the underlying problem that made them seem so&mdash;what&rsquo;s the parlance?&mdash;&ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=indispensible+applications+productivity#sclient=psy&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=1..5000+intitle%3Aindispensable+applications+OR+apps+OR+programs&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=7c8f32f65b860aba">indispensable</a>&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Think: Elmo Band-Aids for that unsightly pancreatic tumor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reducing Distraction through <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/02/05/first-care" title="43 Folders - 'First, care.'"><em>Care</em></a> (Rather than braces, armatures, and puppet strings)</strong>. Removing interruptions and <em>external</em> distractions that harm your work or life? Great. Counting on your distraction-removal tool to supplement your non-existent motivation to do work that will never get done anyway? Pathetic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frankly, this is a big reason I'm so galled when anyone touts their tool/product/service as being the poor, misunderstood artist&rsquo;s new miracle medicine&mdash;rather than just admitting they've made a slightly different spoon.</li>
<li>Because, let&rsquo;s be honest: although most of us have plenty of perfectly serviceable spoons, everybody knows collecting cutlery is way more fun than <em>using</em> it to swallow yucky medicine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using a System Vs. Becoming a System.</strong> Having a system or process for getting work done vs. making the iteration of that system or process a replacement for the work. This is just&hellip;wow&hellip;big. <br/><br />
But, maybe most importantly to me&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embracing the Impossibles.</strong> Getting past these or any other intellectual koans by simply accepting life&rsquo;s innumerable and unresolvable paradoxes, hypocrisies, and impossibilities as God-given gifts of creative constraint. Rather than, say, a mimeographed page of long division problems that must be solved for a whole number, <em>n</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I just can&rsquo;t ever get away from this one. For me, it&rsquo;s what everything inevitably comes back to.</li>
<li>The very definition of our jobs is to solve the right problem at the right level for the right reason&mdash;based on a combination of the best info we have for now and a clear-eyed dedication to never pushing an unnecessary rock up an avoidable hill.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>YET</strong>, we keep force-feeding the monster that tells us to fiddle and fart and blame the Big Cruel World whenever we face work that might threaten our fragile personal mythology.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Sigh. I wish I could finally start writing My Novel&hellip;.Ooooooh, if only I had a slightly nicer pen&hellip;and Zeus loved me more&hellip;.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All that stuff? That there&rsquo;s a complex set of ideas to talk about for many complex reasons&mdash;not least of which being how many people either despise or (try to) deny the  unavoidable impact of ol' number six.</p>
<p>But, here&rsquo;s the thing: as much as saying so pisses anybody off, I think the topics we're NOT talking about whenever we disappear into Talmudic scholarship about &ldquo;full-screen mode&rdquo; or &ldquo;minimalist desks&rdquo; or whatever constitutes a &ldquo;zen habit&rdquo;&mdash;those shunned topics are precisely the things that I believe are most mind-blowingly critical to our real-world happiness as humans.</p>
<p>In fact, I believe that to such a degree that helping provide a voice for those unpopular topics that can be heard over the din is now (what passes for) my career. I really believe these deeper ideas are worth socializing on any number of levels and in many media. Even when it&rsquo;s inconvenient and slightly disrespectful of someone&rsquo;s business model.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s what I try to do. I talk about these things. Seldom by careful design. Often poorly. But, always because they each mean an awful lot to me.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>But, no matter how I end up saying whatever the hell I say, I believe in saying it not simply to be liked or followed or revered as a &ldquo;nice guy&rdquo; who pushes out shit-tons of <em>whatever</em> to &ldquo;help people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because, believe me, friend, a great many of those apparently &ldquo;nice guys&rdquo; swarming around the web &ldquo;helping people&rdquo; these days are ass-fucking their audience for nickels and calling it a complimentary colonoscopy. And, while I absolutely think that in itself is empirically <strong>wrong</strong>, I also think it&rsquo;s just as important to <strong>say</strong> that it&rsquo;s wrong. Sometimes, True Things need to be said.</p>
<p>Which in this instance amounts to saying, a) selling people a prettier way to kinda almost but not really write is not, in the canonical sense, &ldquo;nice&rdquo;&mdash;but, far worse, b) leaving your starry-eyed customers with the nauseatingly misguided impression that their &ldquo;distraction&rdquo; originates from anyplace but their own busted-ass brain is <strong>really</strong> not &ldquo;helping.&rdquo; Not on any level. It is, literally, <em>harmful</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helping&rdquo; a junkie become more efficient at keeping his syringe loaded is hardly &ldquo;nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the opposite of nice. And, it&rsquo;s the opposite of helpful. These are my True Things.</p>
<p>And, to me, saying your True Things also means not watering down the message you care about in order to render it incapable of even conceivably hurting someone&rsquo;s feelings&mdash;or of even conceivably losing you even one teeny-tiny slice of that precious &ldquo;market share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the price, and I'm fine paying it&mdash;best money I've ever spent.</p>
<p>But, it also means trusting your audience by letting each of them decide to add water only as <em>they</em> choose to&mdash;by never corrupting the actual concentrate in a way that might make it less useful to the smartest or most eager 5% of people who'd like to try using it undiluted. Because, at that point, you're not only abandoning the coolest people you have the honor of serving&mdash;you risk becoming a charlatan.</p>
<p>And, that&rsquo;s precisely what you become when you start to iteratively inbreed the kind of fucktard audience for whom daily buffets of weak swill and beige assurance are life&rsquo;s most gratifying reward.</p>
<p>Sure. Those poor bastards may never end up <em>using</em> any of that watery information to do anything more ambitious than turbocharging their most regrettable symptoms. But, who&rsquo;s the last person in the universe who&rsquo;s going to grab them by the ears and tell them to get back to work? Exactly&mdash;that same &ldquo;nice guy&rdquo; whose livelihood now depends on keeping infantalized strangers addicted to his &ldquo;help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holy shit&mdash;no way could I ever live with that. It&rsquo;s so wrong, it&rsquo;s not even right. <code>ESC, ESC, ESC!</code></p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Okay. So anyhow, there&rsquo;s a really long-winded, overly generous, and extremely pompous way of trying to say I don&rsquo;t know how to do what I do except how I do it. But, I do genuinely feel awful when innocent people feel they have been publicly humiliated or berated simply because I'm some dick who hates people.</p>
<p>Which has to be my favorite irony of all.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I thought my Mom was &ldquo;mean&rdquo; not to let me play in traffic on busy Galbraith Road. Today, I'm not simply grateful that she had the strength and resolve to be so &ldquo;mean&rdquo;&mdash;I actually can&rsquo;t imagine how sad it would be to not have people in your life who care enough about your long-term welfare to tell you to stop fucking around in traffic. To where you eventually might start even seeking 12x-daily safety hacks from some of the very same drivers whose recklessness may eventually kill you. Wow.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Admitting when life is complicated or things aren&rsquo;t shiny and happy all the time strikes me as a wonderfully sane and adult way to conduct one&rsquo;s life. That there are so many folks offended by even the existence of this anarchic idea is not a problem I can solve.</p>
<p>No more than I can wish useless email away or pray hard enough that it never rains on anyone&rsquo;s leaky roof. All out of scope.</p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>And, then, I jizzed on at length about how much I admire the recipient&rsquo;s work. Which I do.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Good work doesn&rsquo;t need a cookie</h2>
<p>I may admire your work, too. Especially if you care a lot about that work and don&rsquo;t overly sweat peoples' opinions of it. Most definitely including my own.</p>
<p>For these purposes, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether we're friends and, honestly, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter whether I love, use, or agree with everything you do, say, or make in a given day.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter because good work doesn&rsquo;t need <em>me</em> to love it. Like tornadoes and cold sores, good work happens with total disregard to whether I'm &ldquo;into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, conversely, let&rsquo;s stipulate that the points-of-view undergirding our opinions&mdash;again, including mine&mdash;will and should survive either agreement or <em>lack of agreement</em> with equivalently effortless ease. Because, like <em>really</em> good work, a <em>really</em> good point-of-view doesn&rsquo;t require another person&rsquo;s benediction.</p>
<h2>Guess we'll have to disagree to agree</h2>
<p>Now, to be only vaguely clearer here, I'm not posting this circuitous ego dump in the service of altering your opinion of either me, my friend, his work, or practically anything else for that matter.</p>
<p>But, I would love it if we could all be more okay with the fact that real life means that we do each have a different, sometimes incongruous, and often totally incompatible point-of-view. Yes. <em>Even you</em> have a point-of-view that <strong>someone</strong> despises. Ready to change it now? Jesus, I sure hope not.</p>
<p>Then, to be only slightly more clear, I'm also not advocating for that fakey brand of web-based <em>kum ba ya</em> that gets trotted out alternately as &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; or &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; or some styrofoam miniature of &ldquo;civility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I'm absolutely not <em>against</em> all of those things when authentically practiced, but I'm also really skeptical of the well-branded peacemakers who are forever appointing themselves the Internet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Now-Now-Let&rsquo;s-All-Pretend-We're-Just-Saying-the-Same-Useless-Thing-Here&rdquo; den mothers.</p>
<p>Because we're <strong>not</strong> all saying the same things. Not at all.</p>
<p>And, it infantalizes some important conversations when we tacitly demand that any instance of honest disagreement be immediately horseshat into a photo opp where some thought leader gets to hoist everyone&rsquo;s hands in the air like he&rsquo;s fucking Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>Nope. Not saying that.</p>
<h2>Who will you <em>really</em> rely on?</h2>
<p>What I <strong>AM</strong> saying is that <em>alllllll</em> this seemingly unrelated stuff is absolutely related&mdash;that the pattern of not relying on other people for anything you really care about is arguably the great-grandaddy of every useful productivity, creativity, or self-help pattern.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s this matter? Pretty much everywhere you have any sort of stake:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely on other people to remove your totally fake &ldquo;distractions.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely on other people to pat your beret, re-tie your cravat, and make you a nice cocoa whenever that mean man on the internet points out that your &ldquo;distractions&rdquo; are totally fake. (Which they are)</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely on other people to tell you when or whether you have enough information.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely on other people to define your job.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely on other people to &ldquo;design your lifestyle.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely on other people to decide when your opinions are acceptable.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely on other people to tell you when you're allowed to be awesome.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely on other people to make you <em>care</em>.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t even rely on other people to tell you what you should or shouldn&rsquo;t rely on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. I went there.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the point. These hypocrisies, paradoxes, and ambiguities that people get so wound up about&mdash;that many of us are constantly (impotently) trying to resolve&mdash;<em>cannot be resolved.</em></p>
<p>Because, yeah: all of these harrowingly unsolvable problems are immune to new notebooks and less-distracting applications and shinier systems and &ldquo;nicer&rdquo; self-&ldquo;help&rdquo; and pretty much anything else that is not, specifically, <em>you</em> walking straight into the angriest and least convenient shitstorm you can find and getting your ass kicked until the storm gets bored with kicking it.</p>
<p>Then, you find an even angrier storm. Then, another. And, so on.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Get the fuck off of my obstacle, Private Pyle!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Doing that annoying hard stuff is how you grow, get better, and learn what <em>real</em> help looks like. Even if that&rsquo;s not the answer you wanted to hear. You get better by getting your ass out of your RSS reader and fucking making things until they suck less. Not by buying apps.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t whine about distractions, or derail yourself over needing a nicer pencil sharpener, or aggravate your chronic creative diabetes by starting another desperate waddle to the self-help buffet. No. <em>You work</em>.</p>
<p>And, for what it&rsquo;s worth, just like you can&rsquo;t get to the moon by eating cheese, you'll also never leave boot camp with your original scrote intact by telling your drill sergeant to try using more honey than vinegar.</p>
<p>No. That sergeant&rsquo;s <em>job</em> is to make you miserable. It&rsquo;s his <em>job</em> to break down your callow conceits about what&rsquo;s supposed to be easy and fair. It&rsquo;s his <em>job</em> to emotionally pummel you into giving up and becoming a Marine.</p>
<p>You? You're not there to give the sergeant notes; you're there to sleep two hours a night, then not mind getting beaten for 20 hours until a decent Marine starts to fall out.</p>
<p>Who knows? He may even surprise you by introducing a surprisingly effective &ldquo;distraction-free learning environment.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Tee ell dee ahr, Professor Brainiac.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Like most humans, I like things I can understand. Like most readers, I love specificity. Like most thinkers, I love clarity. Like most students, I love relevance and practicality. And, like most busy people, believe it or not, I actually do really like it when someone gets straight to the point.</p>
<p>But, here&rsquo;s the problem. If my 2-year-old daughter asks me about time travel, and I blithely announce, &ldquo;E=mc<sup>2</sup>&rdquo;, I will have said something that is entirely specific, clear, relevant, practical, and/or straight-to-the-point. For <em>somebody</em>.</p>
<p>But, not so much for my daughter. And, to be honest, not even to any useful degree for me.</p>
<p>She'd probably either laugh derisively at me (which she&rsquo;s great at), or she'd pause and ask, &ldquo;<em>Whuh dat?</em>&rdquo; (which she&rsquo;s even better at).</p>
<p>Thing is, her understanding that jumble of characters less than me&mdash;and my understanding it WAY less than Professor Al&mdash;has zero impact on the profundity, truth, beauty, or impact of the man&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>Sure. You could quite accurately fault me for being a smartass and a poseur, and you could even berate my toddler for her unaccountably shallow understanding of <em>Modern Physics</em>. But, in any case, you can&rsquo;t really blame either Albert or his theory.</p>
<h2>You're turbocharging <em>nothing</em></h2>
<p>Specifically, Albert can&rsquo;t begin to tell us what he <em>really</em> knows if we don&rsquo;t understand math.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s say this theory you've been hearing about really interests you.  And, let&rsquo;s also pretend, just for the sake of the analogy, that you haven&rsquo;t completed <em>Calculus III</em> (212) or <em>Quantum Mechanics</em> (403) or even something as elementary as, say, <em>Advanced Astrophysics II</em> (537). I know <em>you</em> have. Obviously. But, let&rsquo;s pretend. Where do you start?</p>
<p>Well, you could read some tips about learning math. You could find a list of 500 indispensable resources for indispensable math resources. You could buy a new &ldquo;distraction-free math environment.&rdquo; Heck, there&rsquo;s actually nothing to stop you from just declaring yourself a &ldquo;math expert.&rdquo; Congratulations, Professor.</p>
<p><strong>Thing is: <em>you still don&rsquo;t know math</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Which means you still can&rsquo;t <em>really</em> understand the theory&mdash;no more than a pathetic Liberal Arts refugee like me or a dullard Physics ignoramus like my kid can <i>really</i> grok relativity. </p>
<p>  Difference is, you will have blown a lot of time  hoping that actual expertise follows non-existent effort—while my daughter and I get to remain total novices without charge. Only, we don&rsquo;t get all mad at the theory as a result; a staggering number of fake math experts <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>I mean, be honest&mdash;after all that recreational non-work and make-believe dedication almost trying to kinda learn math sorta&mdash;you might actually get frustrated at how brazenly Al defies your fondness for shortcuts by continuing to rely on so many terms and proofs and blah-blah-blah that you still just don&rsquo;t understand. So annoying.</p>
<p>You may simply decide that Albert Einstein&rsquo;s a huge dick for never saying things that can be completely understood solely by scanning a headline.</p>
<p><em>EPIC EINSTEIN FAIL</em>, amirite?</p>
<h2>You never really know what you didn&rsquo;t know until you know it</h2>
<p>But, Al just told the truth. </p>
<p>Problem is, Al&rsquo;s truth not only <em>requires</em> fancy things in order to be truly understood&mdash;the more of those fancy things you take away from his truth, the less true it gets. And, by the time it&rsquo;s been diluted to the point where you're comfortable that you understand it? You'd be understanding the wrong thing. Even I can understand that.</p>
<p>But, not one bit of <em>any of this</em> is Al&rsquo;s fault. Al doesn&rsquo;t get to control who uses, abuses, gets, or doesn&rsquo;t get what he said or why it matters. Especially since he&rsquo;s been dead for over fifty years.</p>
<p>All I know is, regardless of who has ears to hear it on a given day, it would be to Al&rsquo;s credit never to mangle something important in order to get it into terms everybody&rsquo;s ready to handle without actually trying.</p>
<p>And God bless him for never agreeing that your &ldquo;distractions&rdquo; to learning math are <em>his</em> problem.</p>
<p>So, yeah, if you only need to hand in a crappy 5-page paper, you could certainly <em>Cliff&rsquo;s Notes</em> your way through Borges, Eliot, or Joyce in an afternoon, and feel like you haven&rsquo;t missed a thing. Trouble is, if you <em>did care</em> even a little, it&rsquo;s impossible to even say how much you're missing since you can&rsquo;t be bothered to soldier through the source text. The text itself is the entire point.</p>
<p>Even the wonderfully cogent and readable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691120277?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=43folders-20" title="Amazon: 'The Meaning of Relativity, Fifth Edition: Including the Relativistic Theory of the Non-Symmetric Field' by Albert Einstein">layman&rsquo;s explanations</a> Einstein himself provided don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> get to the nut, the application, and the implications of his <em>real</em> theory.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> all takes <em>real</em> math.</p>
<h2>That &ldquo;single datum of experience&rdquo; <em>matters</em></h2>
<p>Sometimes, complex or difficult things stop being true when you try to make them too simple. Sometimes, you have to actually get laid to understand why people think sex is such a thing. Sometimes, you need to learn some Greek if you <em>really</em> want to understand <em>The Gospel of John</em>. And, yeah, sometimes, you're going to have to just work unbelievably hard at whatever you claim to care about before anyone can begin to help you get any better&mdash;or less &ldquo;distracted&rdquo;&mdash;at it.</p>
<p>The part I really know is what <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> work. Reading <em>Penthouse Forum</em> won&rsquo;t help you CLEP out of <em>Vaginal Intercourse 101</em>. Watching a Rankin-Bass cartoon about the Easter Bunny will teach you very little about the intricacies of transubstantiation. And, if you can&rsquo;t be troubled to care so much about your work that you reflexively <em>force</em> distractions away, dicking around with yet another writing application will merely aggravate the problem. Ironic, huh?</p>
<p>These quantum mechanics of personal productivity are rife with such frustrating &ldquo;paradoxes.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>These are True Things.</h2>
<p>Achieving expertise and doing  creative work is   all horribly complicated and difficult and paradoxical and frustrating and recursive and James Joyce-y&mdash;and any guide, blog, binary, guru, or &ldquo;nice guy&rdquo; that tries to suggest otherwise is probably giving you a complimentary colonoscopy. Do the math.</p>
<p>Want a new syllabus? Sure:</p>
<p>Run straight into your shitstorm, my friends. Reject the impulse to think about work, rather than finishing it. And, open your heart to the remote possibility that any mythology of personal failure that involves messiahs periodically arriving to make everything &ldquo;easy&rdquo; for you might not <em>really</em> be helping your work <em>or</em> your mental health <em>or</em> your long-standing addiction to using tools solely to ship new excuses.</p>
<p>Learn <em>your</em> real math, and any slide rule will suffice. Try, make, and do until you quit noticing the tools, and if you still think you need new tools, go try, make, and do more.</p>
<p>If you can pull off this deceptively simple and millennia-old pattern, you'll eventually find that&mdash;god by dying god&mdash;any partial truth that&rsquo;s supported your treasured excuses for not working will be replaced by a no-faith-required knowledge that you're really, actually, <em>finally</em> getting better at something you care about.</p>
<p>Which is just <em>sublimely</em> un-distracting.</p>

<h5>Dedication</h5>
<p>This article is dedicated to my friend, <a href="http://www.eod.com/"><strong>Greg Knauss</strong></a>. No, he&#8217;s not the app guy&#8211;he&#8217;s just a good man who does good work, who accidentally/unintentionally helped me write this rant. He also happens to be a fella who could teach anyone a thing or two about writing with distractions. <em>Thanks, Greg</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Let's be honest. I don't go...mmmm...<em>places</em> very often.</p>

<p>I sit in this chair. I go to the Safeway with my daughter. Sometimes, I take the train downtown to get a haircut. I check the mail.</p>

<p>But, by and large, like most nerds, I'm without question, a bit of a shut-in.</p>

<p>Which makes it more than a little  ironic that my first trip off the North American continent brought me all the way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton">Brighton, England</a>'s wonderful <a href="http://2010.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct Conference</a>.</p>

<p><!--more-->
<!--break--></p>

<p>Which wonderful conference placed me inside a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Pavilion">very royal complex</a>, alone on a <a href="http://www.brightondome.org/">very large stage</a>, 90 seconds after being informed I'd better be entertaining, because I'd be conducting my oration on the same spot where, a scant 36 years earlier, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBA">ABBA</a> had become <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpLmBvHdnAA">international stars</a> by singing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_%28ABBA_song%29">an up-tempo number</a> about <a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/Abba%20Lyrics/Waterloo%20Lyrics.html">giving up</a>. So, y'know. <em>No pressure</em>.</p>

<p><em>Commanded</em> to this location by two of my <a href="http://clearleft.com/is/andybudd/">web</a> <a href="http://clearleft.com/is/jeremykeith/">heroes</a>, I was told I could speak about whatever I wanted. So, wow, to quote the ladies of ABBA, <em>how could I ever refuse?</em></p>

<p>Thus, I stood on that stage for over 35 minutes, rambling to 800 talented, creative people about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, <a href="http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/blog/andrew-blauvelt-walker-art-center/">japanese</a> <a href="http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/">toothpicks</a>, torrenting Photoshop, as well as what I used to find myself doing after a long evening of shooting mutants in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_(video_game)">Stargate</a>.<sup id="fnref:vickisecret"><a href="#fn:vickisecret" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But, mostly? Yes. Mostly, I stood on a stage thousands of miles from the chair from which I barely move, and I told a lot of really smart people that they were <em>nerds</em>. I also told them they should get out more.</p>

<p>I swear: it made sense at the time.</p>

<p><a href="(http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/blog/andrew-blauvelt-walker-art-center/)"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100910-pqmfm63sgrxkp61urk1nj8gigd.jpg" alt="toothpick" width="500" height="*"/></a></p>

<h2>Some Serious Talent</h2>

<p>My talk about the challenges and opportunities of being a giant nerd seemed well received. Honestly, I'm <em>very</em> happy with how it turned out. But--oh, brother--was I ever up against some heavy hitters. <a href="http://2010.dconstruct.org/speakers/">Serious Lou Gehrig shit</a>.</p>

<p>I'll leave it to <a href="http://plus.abitgone.co.uk/dconstruct-2010">other</a>, <a href="http://www.robbiemanson.com/articles/dconstruct-2010/">more</a> <a href="http://sam.brown.tc/entry/439/dconstruct-2010-my-experience-graph">eloquent</a> <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1691/">folks</a> to tell you what a wonderful day this was. But I <em>will</em> very much suggest you learn this for yourself by listening to the <a href="#listen">audio of the <em>fantastic</em> talks</a>. Because every one of them is a corker.</p>

<p>Additionally, like I <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/1078482441/grouchy-web-pope">said</a>, <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/">Tom Coates</a> put on one of the loveliest <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/plasticbag/4973522275/">slide decks</a> it's ever been my pleasure to see (<a href="http://plasticbag.org/files/misc/everything-the-network-touches.pdf">56MB PDF</a>).</p>

<p>Great speakers, great hosts, <em>wonderful</em> attendees (who aren't above buying a yank a pint [thanks, everybody]).</p>

<h2>And, Thanks, dConstruct</h2>

<p>I have to admit, I'm kind of <em>over</em> conferences as a thing, which makes it even more crazy when I go to one, and it blows me out of the water with the care and quality of the event, the speakers, and the attendees. dConstruct was absolutely one of those blown-out-of-the-water events.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29022619@N03/4969018314/in/set-72157624779022789/" title="Merlin Mann by happy.apple, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4146/4969018314_0e0e8e84d1.jpg" width="353" height="500" alt="Merlin Mann" /></a><br />

<p>As I learned over and over again--yes, like me--these folks are nerds. But, brother are they ever talented nerds who care and <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/02/05/first-care">care</a>. Which I just love <em>so</em> much.</p>

<p>I'll take a nerdy bunch of fontdorks and <a href="http://vimeo.com/14769601">cellists</a> over a splashy mega-conference full of VC pitches and skanks pushing free Red Bull anytime. <em>Anytime</em>.</p>

<p>dConstruct was simply a top-notch operation from end-to-end, and I'm insanely grateful that I was invited to participate. Thanks, <a href="http://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a>.</p>

<p>And, you, the reader? If you get the chance next time, <a href="http://2011.dconstruct.org/"><em>go</em></a>. Heck, I might even leave this chair and go there, myself. Maybe.</p>

<p>I suppose when Dr. Who's over, I could just let these 20-sided dice decide for me. Lemme see...what's my Armor Class and Hit Points...?</p>

<p>This poor kid emailed me to ask a really simple question. And I went and saddled him with the world's most circuitously long-winded answer. Surprise, surprise.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hey, Xx,</p>

<p>Thanks for the note, man. No I'm sorry its not up as audio AFAIK.</p>

<p>FWIW, it's a talk I'm asked to do more often lately so I wouldn't be surprised if it turns up sooner or later.</p>

<p>Since you were kind enough to ask, the talk—which comes out super different each time I do it— consists of a discursive mishmash of advice I wish I'd had the ears to hear in the year or five after graduating from college: primarily, that we never end up anywhere near where we'd expected, and that most of us would have been a lot happier a lot faster if we'd realized that we were often obsessing over the wrong things—starting with how much the world should care about our major. ("<a href="http://ncf.edu/">Liberal Arts</a>," with a concentration in [ugh] "Cultural Studies," thanks.)</p>

<p>The talk started as a way to encourage students to learn enough about what they care about that any temporary derails and side roads wouldn't scare their horses too badly. But, today, I see it as something a lot bigger that's demonstrably useful to anyone who hopes to survive, evolve, and thrive in this insane world.</p>

<p>A handful of bits I'm (obviously) still synthesizing into something notionally cohesive:</p>

<hr />

<h2>My Kingdom for Some <em>Context</em>!</h2>

<p>For myself, I wish I'd known the value of developing early expertise in interesting new skills around emerging technologies (rather than just iteratively pseudo-honing the 202-level skills I thought I "understood"). Alongside that, I wish I'd learned to embrace the non-douchier aspects of building awesome human relationships (as against "networking" in the service  of landing some straight job that, as with most hungry young people, locked me into a carpeted prison of monkey work  at the worst time possible).</p>

<p>Also how I wish I'd paid more attention to events, contexts, relationships, and change that were happening outside my immediate world —rather than becoming, say, the undisputed master of fretting about status, salary, and whether I was "a success" who had "arrived".</p>

<p><strong>Hint</strong>: I was not a "success," and I had not, by any stretch, "arrived."</p>

<p>To my mind, "success" in the real world is much more the equivalent of achieving a new personal best; it's not about whether you won the "Springtime in Springfield SunnyD®/Q105™ 5k FunRun for Entitilitus," and got a little ribbon with a gold crest on it.</p>

<p>Truly, pretty much anyone who feels they've "arrived" <em>anyplace</em> is about to learn a) how much more they could be doing outside the narrowness of an often superficial ambition and b) the surprising number of things they had to give away through the opportunity costs and trade-offs that lead up to <em>every</em> theoretical milestone. It's a real goddamned thistle, and it's more than a little depressing.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Do You Still <em>Really</em> Want to be a Fireman?</h2>

<p>[<em>N.B.: I really hope you're taking bathroom breaks here, Xx</em>]</p>

<p>Related, I think this is about how being an adult is not only unbelievably complicated in ways that you can't begin to imagine—that it's frequently defined by impossible decisions and non-stop layers of "hypocrisy"—but that there's an invisible but entirely real risk to doggedly chasing the theoretically laudable notion of "following your dream." Especially if it's a dream you first had while sleeping on Star Wars sheets in a racecar bed.</p>

<p>Not because it's a bad idea to want things or to have ambitions. Quite the opposite. More because, for a lot of us, the "dreams" of youth turn out to be half-finished blueprints for wax wings. And not particularly flattering ones at that.</p>

<p>By starting adult life with an autistically explicit "goal" that's never been tested against any kind of real-world experience or reality-in-context, we can paradoxically miss a thousand more useful, lucrative, or organic opportunities that just…what?…<em>pop up</em>. Often these are one-time chances to do amazing and even unique things—opportunities that many of us continue to reject out of hand because it's "not what we do."</p>

<p>It took me a full decade to learn to embrace the unfamiliar gifts that kismet loves to deliver on our busiest and most stressful days, and which gifts might (maybe/maybe not) even end up bringing the real-life, non-racecar-bed, <em>now</em> me a big step closer to something that's 1000 times more interesting than a hollow, ten-year-old caricature of "what I wanna be when I grow up."</p>

<hr />

<h2>Finding Your "Old Butcher"</h2>

<p>Also related, it strikes me that the indisputable wealth of information and options that are provided by the web often comes with a harrowing hidden tradeoff. While we can certainly learn a lot on our own and become (what feels like) an instant expert on any topic in an afternoon, we usually do so in the absence of a mentor and outside the context of <em>applying</em> expertise to solve actual problems. In my opinion, a cadet should have to survive more than  a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru">Kobayashi Maru scenarios</a> before he gets to declare himself, "Captain."</p>

<p>Call it a guru, a wizard, an <a href="http://i-0.us/MM-for-now">old butcher</a>, or what have you, the mad echo chamber of a young mind often benefits from the dampening influence of an experienced grownup who can help you understand things that raw data, wikipedia entries, and lists of tips and tricks can't and wont ever do.</p>

<p>We benefit from a hand on the back and a gentle voice, reminding us:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Try not to obsess over implementation until you really understand the problem," or </li>
<li>"Worry more about relationships than org charts or follower counts," or </li>
<li>"Don't quit looking after you've found that first data point," or—my favorite—</li>
<li>"Spend less time fantasizing about 'success' and way more time making really cool mistakes."</li>
</ul>

<p>Conversely, though, I think this  means that everything we <em>think</em> we know, as well as all the fancy advice that gets thrown around—absolutely including the material you're reading now—is the product of what one person knows and what another person has the ears to hear. For us. For now. For who really knows what. But it is a transaction that takes place in a very specific time and within the bounds of a set of "known" "facts." So, fair warning, doing your own due diligence never hurts.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What's <em>Almost</em> Not Impossible?</h2>

<p>[<em>N.B.: I swear to God this ends at some point, Xx</em>]</p>

<p>One big pattern for "future-proofing" your passion? Keep your eyes open and your heart even "<em>opener</em>." And, be more than simply tolerant of the notion of change—sure, take it as read that nothing is ever fixed in place for more than a little while.</p>

<p>But, to the extent that your sanity can bear it, <em>always</em> keep an eye on the corners, the edges, and especially learn to watch for those infinitesimally tiny figures starting to shuffle around near the horizon. Because a lot of the things that seem ridiculously small and inconsequential right now will eventually cast a shadow that people will be chasing for decades. It's just that we're never sure which tiny figure that will turn out to be.</p>

<p>So, yeah. It really is true that no one but you cares about your major. But, trust me:  <em>everybody</em> is interested in the person who repeatedly notices the things that are about to stop being impossible.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/6670594819" title="For better or worse, every decade's defined by what stopped seeming impossible."><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100518-tfhjq7wguhufq3ni1wbx5ymnkb.jpg" alt="For better or worse, every decade's defined by what stopped seeming impossible." /></a></p>

<p>Be the curious one who soaks in all that "irrelevant" stuff. And, even as you stay heads-down on the "now" projects that keep the lights on, remember that the guy who <em>invented</em> those lights made hundreds of "failed" lightbulbs before fundamentally upending the way we think about time, family, industry, and the role of technology in how we live and work. But, yes, first he "failed" a lot <em>a lot</em> at something which more than a few of his contemporaries thought was pointless in the first place.</p>

<p>Ask: What's out there right now that's about to stop being impossible? Where will it happen first? Who will  (most loudly and erroneously) declare it's total bullshit? Who will mostly get it right—but possibly too early? Who will figure out what it means to our grandkids? Who will figure out how to put it in everyone's front pocket for a quarter?</p>

<p>Y'know who? I'll tell you who: <em>practically anybody <strong>BUT</strong> that guy in the racecar bed who wants to talk about his major</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Important: Merlin's Advice is Only Future-Proof to 10 Meters</h2>

<p>A few years back, most watch manufacturers decided to come clean and stop categorically declaring that their timepieces were "waterproof." Instead, today, the more credible vendors admit their product is merely "water-resistant"—and, even then, they'll only guarantee the underwater functionality at so many meters, and for so long, and under thus and such conditions.</p>

<p>Truthfully, the same applies here. Nothing can actually "future-proof" anything. Anyone who claims to know the future is either a madman, a charlatan, or, often as not, both.</p>

<p>Thing is, regardless of the passions (or goals or values or priorities or whatever) that we hope to protect or defend, we'd all do well to remember that it is still ultimately <em>OUR</em> passion that's at stake.</p>

<p>That means we're the only one responsible for seeing that its functional components survive and adapt in a world in which each one of us has just north of zero control.</p>

<p>If we embrace the fact that no one can or should ever care about the health of our passions as much as we do, the practical decisions that help ensure Our Good Thing stays alive can become as "simple" as a handful of proven patterns—work hard, stay awake, fail well, hang with smart people, shed bullshit, say "maybe," focus on action, and always <em>always</em> commit yourself to a bracing daily mixture of all the courage, honesty, and information you need to do something awesome—discover whatever it'll take to keep your nose on the side of the ocean where the fresh air lives. This is <em>huge</em>.</p>

<p>Anything else? Yeah. Drink lots of water, play with your kid every chance you get, and quit Facebook today. No, really, do it.</p>

<p>Thanks again for the note, Xx, and sorry for the novella.  I'll ping you if the audio ever turns up. Til then, forget your major, and  break a leg!</p>

<p>This is a <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/news/2010/3/12/merlin-presents-3-free-talks-at-rutgers-university.html">talk I did at Rutgers</a> earlier this month. I kinda like it, but for a weird reason. Something something, perfect storm of technology Ragnarok, and yadda yadda, I had to start the talk 20 minutes late with no slides. <em>Nothing</em>.</p>

<p>So, I riffed.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>And, I ended up talking about a lot of the <em>new</em> stuff you can expect to see in the <em>Inbox Zero</em> book—work culture, managing expectations, the 3 deadly qualities of email, and one surprising reason email's not as much fun as <em>Project Runway</em>.</p>

<p>Some people liked it. I think. I liked it. I hope you do, too.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/merlinmann/who-moved-my-brain-revaluing-time-attention-410-edition">slides</a> I would have shown. ;-)</p>

<p>If it hasn't been obvious, or you couldn't just guess, this book project's been a big rock for me. Given the effort it's taken (read: most every hour I'm not sleeping, working, or pushing my  daughter in a swing), it's also the primary reason why updates to 43 Folders have been so scarce over the last few months. The spirit was willing, but the brain--insanely sick of thinking about these very topics--was weak.</p>

<p>Yes, as it turns out, writing a book does require an extraordinary expenditure of both attention <em>and</em> time. And, in my own case, I'll confess that this often meant working even more than <a href="http://qpradio.org/post/75687764/14-second">four hours a week</a>. But, who knows? Maybe that's just a consequence of my slow typing and abject lack of lifetrepreneurship.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Thing is, this has also been a fantastic and exhilarating time for me. Despite the pressure, the stress, and the alternating tickity-tock of both clock and keyboard, in the end, performing the architecture and masonry required to build such a large project demanded that I gather a lot of seemingly unrelated material, choose the most promising ingredients, and then heat it all up in a  deadline-fueled crucible. Sure, it's been mostly good pressure (who the hell complains about having a book deal?), but it's still been real pressure.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with much relief and abundant gratitude, I can say that I'm really satisfied with the emerging artifact. And, of course, I really hope you guys feel the same way when the book comes out. Probably some time in the fall of 2049.</p>

<h2>Coming Up for Air</h2>

<p>I mention all this here because, if you follow any of the stuff I <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/projects">do and say</a> <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/media">elsewhere</a>, you'll have noticed a recent uptick in the number of appearances I've been making around the web. That's the happy confluence of my (finally) coming up for air, combined with my determination to (finally) make good on endless months of snoozed and punted and re-re-re-scheduled interview requests from some very cool people, publications, and podcasts.  (Thanks to everyone who's asked and, if I missed you, please <a href="http://merlinmann.com/contact">ask again</a>.)</p>

<p>So, today, I beg your indulgence to share three recent interviews with me that I like quite a lot.</p>

<p>While all three are <em>profiles</em> of me and what I've been doing and thinking about as I work on this infernal book business, they also each bear directly on the topics that I know mean a lot to you guys, too. Especially, if you're one of the band of brothers who've stuck with me and courageously kept this XML-enabled null space in your feed reader since my much-discussed <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/09/08/four-years">shift away from productivity pr0n</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, by way of inarguably self-involved catch-up--and as an informal reintroduction to how I <a href="http://www.43folders.com/about">truly believe</a> you can "find the time and attention to do your best creative work"--here's three recent interviews:</p>

<ol>
<li>on the values of <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/03/18/crucible#pipeline">voice, openness, and making mindful creative work</a>; </li>
<li>on a <em>very</em> <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/03/18/crucible#mpu">detailed exegesis of my tactical workflow</a>; </li>
<li>on the benefits of <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/03/18/crucible#mfc">diving into the projects that terrify you</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I really hope you'll like them.</p>

<p>My longtime hero, <a href="http://hivelogic.com">Hivelogic</a>'s Dan Benjamin, recently invited me onto <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5 by 5</a>'s flagship podcast, "<a href="http://5by5.tv/pipeline">The Pipeline</a>." While it was intimidating to know I'd be standing alongside such august (and superior) talent as <a href="http://5by5.tv/pipeline/1">Zeldman</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/pipeline/6">Haughey</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/pipeline/4">Coudal</a>, and <a href="http://5by5.tv/pipeline/5">Inman</a>, I was honored to be asked, and I'm extremely happy with the results.</p>

<p>We cover a lot of territory in less than 40 minutes, but we basically hit on almost every major topic that means a lot to me right now, including, the power of voice, the challenges of knowledge work, the perils of the Lizard Brain, the primacy of action, the seeming unavoidability of Buddhism, and the hidden dangers of following herds, chasing dumb traffic, and aping the "success" of others.</p>

<p>Thanks much for this opportunity, Dan. You're a real pro.</p>

<p>Averse as I am to promoting <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/09/10/time-attention-creative-work">productivity pr0n for its own sake</a>, this tour de force podcast should be a <em>lot</em> of fun to anyone who's interested in Mac and iPhone workflows.</p>

<p>Because, believe it or not, I am besieged with daily requests for details on how I actually <em>work</em>. And, if you have even the vaguest passing interest in how I currently sew together <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>, <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>, <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a>, <a href="http://tapbots.com/pastebot">Pastebot</a>, <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>, <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com">Simplenote</a>, <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com">Scrivener</a>, <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown">MultiMarkdown</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_%28software%29">Quicksilver</a>, and more, more, more, prepare for your head to explode multiple times. There's a lot here, so don't miss <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2010/03/mpu-023-workflows-with-merlin-mann/">Katie's exhaustive show notes</a> for a full run-down.</p>

<p>But, <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/media/2010/3/13/audio-merlins-detailed-workflow-on-mac-power-users-podcast.html">like I said</a>, <strong>please do take all this in doses</strong>. This is something I've evolved over years, so you certainly don't need to stop what you're doing to  try to implement <em>all</em> of this.</p>

<p>Still, I have to say, this podcast lays out an empirically  nerdtastic workflow which even the dorkiest Mac fanboy will find something new and awesome in. And, yes, there's loads of non-tool-fetish advice on how to <strong>do</strong> the actual work. I promise.</p>

<p>Thanks so much to David and Katie for putting up with 90 minutes of me talking  <em>very</em> quickly about the most embarrassing details  of my encompassing Mac dorkery.</p>

<p>I'm an unapologetic fan of everything <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org">Jesse Thorn</a> does, including <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/sound-young-america">The Sound of Young America</a>, <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/jordan-jesse-go">Jordan Jesse GO!</a>, and, of course, his annual conference celebrating all things <em>awesome</em>, <a href="http://maxfuncon.com">MaxFunCon</a>. In fact, you may remember <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2009/08/04/enough">the talk on "Getting Started"</a> that I presented at MFC last year.</p>

<p>In this admittedly rambling (but hopefully charming) interview, Jesse and I talk about what makes MaxFunCon so special, as well as how a person who's as--to use Jesse's parlance--"ADD-addled" as I am can actually put a 50,000-word book together. Along the way I profess my love for <a href="http://www.mariabamford.com/">Maria Bamford</a>, <a href="http://jonathancoulton.com/">Jonathan Coulton</a>, and <a href="http://www.nerdist.com/">Chris Hardwick</a>, as well as extol the virtues of drinking vodka from a glass skull with <a href="http://www.areasofmyexpertise.com">John Hodgman</a>.</p>

<p>Silliness aside, we talk frankly about the pants-be-crapping fear of performing (and the more profound terror of <em>sucking</em> at performing) that dogs anyone who's ever decided to get up in front of a bunch of strangers and try to be entertaining. It's hard. So hard. Which is kind of why I love it.</p>

<p>Alas, MaxFunCon 2010 is now way sold out, but you can claim your spot on the waiting list by writing to maxfuncon at gmail. It is, as I've repeatedly said, easily the best conference I've ever attended. Ever. Even more than DB/Expo '97.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thanks for your patience with this one, and sorry in advance if this seems all <em>me-me-me</em>.</p>

<p>But, if anything, 43 Folders is a site that started and still exists for me to share what has and hasn't worked for me along the road to trying to make great stuff.</p>

<p>I hope all three of these interviews will be of interest to anyone who walks that same road, stumbles onto those same shoulders, and shares my cardinal interest in always dusting yourself off, stepping back on the path, and plodding toward whatever comes next.</p>

<p>Onward, friends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hard drives are fragile. Read as much as you can bear to about how they work, how incredibly precisely they must operate in order to cram so many bits onto such small disks. It’s a miracle to me that they work at all. Every hard drive in the world will eventually fail. Assume that yours are all on the cusp of failure at all times. It’s good to be spooked about how long your hard drives will last.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John's article, advice, and success story about doing smart backup is exactly the reminder that a lot of people need to hear right this second. Because, it's impossible to overstate the importance of automated, redundant, and rotated backups. Trust me. You will need them all. Soon. Repeatedly. Forever. Always.</p>

<p>Worst of all, every stupid cliche about backup that currently makes you roll your eyes in exasperation will be visited upon you tenfold if you're not using some flavor of the anal-retentive system nerds like John and I live by. Because, unfortunately, most people you know (including me) have already repeatedly been  struck by backup's biggest and most profound cliche:</p>

<p><strong>Perform automated, redundant, and rotated backups as often as you can afford to lose <em>every single bit of information</em> that's been changed or  added since your last backup. Because it's going to go away.</strong></p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>The Holy Trinity</h2>

<p>Seriously:</p>

<ul>
<li>If it's not automated, <em>it's not a real backup</em>. </li>
<li>If it's not redundant, <em>it's not a real backup</em>. </li>
<li>If it's not regularly rotated off-site, <em>it's not a real backup</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/themerlinshowhi/Scheduled_Copies-20100315-160611.png"><img src="http://media.libsyn.com/media/themerlinshowhi/Scheduled_Copies-20100315-160611.png" alt="" width="500" height="*" /></a></p>

<p>Doing any <em>one</em> of these things by itself or in tandem produces "a copy." A copy is handy, and it may really save you, even a majority of the time. But, making casual copies is optimistic at best. Someday, you will need the benefits of all three layers, and you'll thank John, me, and your chosen <code>$diety</code> that you sweated all those years of monkey work and aggravation.</p>

<p><a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/themerlinshowhi/Inbox__Monthly_Bak_-_EVEN_Monthly_Bak.png"><img src="http://media.libsyn.com/media/themerlinshowhi/Inbox__Monthly_Bak_-_EVEN_Monthly_Bak.png" alt="" width="500" height="*" /></a></p>

<h2>The Next Layer</h2>

<p>I do have three suggestions to append to John's excellent setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Schedule Every Rotation; Then Do it</strong>. Peg your off-site rotation to a date-certain (like how you probably changed the 9-volt in your smoke alarm for Daylight Savings Time yesterday). I do my rotations within the first five days of each new month. So, yes, do automate the creation of backups, but then also do the physical rotation like you'd pay your mortgage. On time and without fail.<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Make and Update Specialized Disk Images</strong>. If the photos of your baby, the videos of your wedding, or those gigs of torrented Radiohead MP3s you've hoarded mean anything to you, give them extra-special treatment. At least every six months or so, burn them <em>all</em> onto drive(s) and rotate them off-site too. Either stick them in a safe-deposit box, or, even better, burn a new DVD of your kid's progress every month, then mail it to the relatives. Distributed backup plus familial bonding = win/win.</li>
<li><strong>Make and Update Multiple "Go-Sticks"</strong>. Buy a bunch of good 4GB+ USB sticks and use them to hold 256-bit-encrypted sparsebundles of your "Holy Shit!" files. Keychains, 1Password files, bank account numbers, insurance records, etc. Anything you need to either start recovering from a catastrophe or go on the lam. Make multiples, schedule update reminders, swap them out in known locations, and, if you have the skillz, maybe set up an Automator script that automatically updates the contents of each drive whenever you plug the little buggers in.</li>
</ul>

<p>You're so sick of hearing this: automated, redundant, and rotated.</p>

<h2>The Godfather of Ass-Saving</h2>

<p>Also, a second high-five for DiskWarrior. I can't count the number of times that this annoying, ugly, slow, and hard-to-use application has saved  every last strip of my bacon. Like John says, yeah, start with Disk Utility, because it's got 90+% of the firepower needed to fix the disk problems you'll encounter this year. But, DiskWarrior will do everything right up to the impossible. And, again, <em>yes</em>: you will need it. I sure have.</p>

<h2>Go. Do it. Now.</h2>

<p>Backup is boring, it's tedious, and it's not cheap. But once you've had your ass handed to you by a badly-broken drive, you really get the importance of a zero-latency recovery. It's positively liberating.</p>

<p>But, for now, right this second: go Gmail your kid's baby pictures to yourself. Do it.</p>

<p>I realize I'm asking you to buy a <em>lot</em> of hard drives here. Can't change that, but I will say I've been very satisfied with <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148433">1TB Seagate Barracudas</a> from <a href="http://www.newegg.com">New Egg</a> (Personally, I buy them five at a time and always have at least 3 spares). The performance is fine, if unremarkable, in both my Macs and my two Drobos. Plus, the price is right, and  New Egg is, in my experience, a proven and bulletproof retailer. Also, if you're the tidy type, you can cheaply pick up a case of <a href="http://www.wiebetech.com/products/cases.php">Wiebetech boxes</a> to transport and store your naked drives.&#160;<a href="#fnref:fn1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anonymous asked: 'How do you maintain focus (on work, dreams, goals, life)?'<br />
  <br />
  <strong>You do one thing at a time.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might be amazed how many times--and over how many years--a given person can ask this same simple question, hear that same simple response, and <strong>still</strong> find themselves casting about for the great and arcane "secret" to achieving real focus.</p>

<p>But, this is pretty much it. Mostly.</p>

<p>Although, I must add one important "Step Zero," borne of my own tedious experience.</p>

<p><strong>Before you sweat the logistics of focus: first, care. <em>Care intensely</em>.</strong></p>

<p><!--more-->
<!--break--></p>

<p>Specifically, if you discover, in frustration, that you're pathologically incapable of doing one thing at a time, consider the possibility that you've been unknowingly trying to "focus" on two, twenty, or twenty thousand disparate things that you don't <em>really</em> care that much about. Just <em>consider</em> it.</p>

<p>Because, in the absence of caring, you'll never focus on anything more than your lack of focus. Think about it.</p>

<p>Think about those times when you really disappeared into challenging work. You had to tear yourself away, right?</p>

<p>Because, during those happy times you were fortunate enough to  find yourself engaged with something that you cared intensely about, you probably started asking a really different sort of question.</p>

<p>A more transitive, muscular question that shows you own the attention that others may see as a bowl full of complimentary Jolly Ranchers, free for the grabbing.</p>

<p>That's when you ask,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How many things do  I need to shed, cancel, defer, drop, shank, or shit-can with extreme prejudice in order to singlemindedly focus on this one thing that I love?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience (yes, as I said, hard-won experience), obsessing over the slipperiness of focus, bemoaning the volume of those devil "distractions," and constantly reassessing which shiny new "system" might make your life suddenly seem more sensible--these are all terrifically useful warning flares that you may be suffering from a deeper, more fundamental problem.</p>

<h3>Where's the care?</h3>

<p>For as long as you know in your heart that what you're making or doing matters, and, consequently, for as long as you accept and  embrace the immutable laws of scarcity, your options for maintaining focus will, like Frank's perfect answer, remain stunningly obvious.</p>

<p>You "focus" on the one thing you care about, as you "unfocus" on everything else. If not for every minute of your life, at least for the time you set aside to pursue the thing that matters.</p>

<p>If that sounds fancy and oversimplified,  then you "care" about too many things. Period.</p>

<p>My suggestion? Own your distractions, resist fiddly half-measures, and never for a minute allow yourself to believe that productivity systems, space pens, or a writing app that plays new age music while you stare at a blank page in full-screen mode can ever teach you anything about how to care.</p>

<p>That's all on you.</p>

<p>So, first, <em>care</em>. Then, as you'll happily and unavoidably discover, all that "focus" business has a peculiar way of taking care of itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm a three-time (soon to be four-time) published author. When aspiring authors learn this, they invariably ask what word processor I use. <em>It doesn't fucking matter!</em></p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Picking the right text editor will not make you a better writer. Writing will make you a better writer. Writing, and editing, and publishing, and listening -- really listening -- to what people say about your writing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said in <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/01/26/godin-linchpin" title="43 Folders - Interview with &quot;Linchpin&quot; author, Seth Godin">that interview with Seth Godin</a>, most people are taken <em>way</em> aback when they unknowingly receive <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/12/03/real-advice-hurts" title="Real Advice Hurts | 43 Folders">the advice they really need</a> &mdash; rather than the advice that's just <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2009/10/22/who-you-are" title="Makebelieve Help, Old Butchers, and Figuring Out Who You Are (For Now) | 43 Folders">fun to listen to</a>. Well, guess what, Fiddly McMaybewriter? Mark's your new coach, so get ready to run some bleachers.</p>

<p><!--more-->

<p>I don't always agree with Mark (oh, brother, don't I), but I've always <em>really</em> admired his candor and fearlessness in speaking his mind about the stuff that really matters to him. In this instance,   I <em>double admire</em> him for publicly challenging the crap myths of creativity pr0n that  create way more <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2009/08/04/enough" title="Fake Rocks, Salami Commanders, and Just Enough to Start | 43 Folders">fake barriers</a> than books.</p>

<p>Like Mark said, the art here is to combine a thick skin with open ears and a great filter. Because, the real growth opportunities come from getting outside your own head and hearing what people <em>really</em> think of your work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learn how to respond to constructive criticism and filter out the trolls, and you can write the next great American novel in edlin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heh &mdash;&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edlin"><em>edlin</em></a>.</p>

<p>Also, do be sure to read Mark's whole UseThis interview (one of which Waferbaby and I are working on for me, as well). It's a great insight into how arriving at a streamlined, bullshit-free setup could make one guy hope to use precisely the same setup for the next 20 years. Super-interesting.</p>
