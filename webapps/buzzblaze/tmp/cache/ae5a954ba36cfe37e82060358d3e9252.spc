Apple&#8217;s fortunes have arguably followed these trends.  Reading John Gruber&#8217;s response to <a href="http://blog.readability.com/2011/02/an-open-letter-to-apple/">Readability&#8217;s open letter to Apple</a> on Apple&#8217;s new subscription policy surprised me to say the least:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Readability needs Apple to publish an app in the App Store. Apple doesn’t need Readability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without Readability and innovative small businesses like it, the App Store is <em>nothing</em>.  What&#8217;s an App Store without Apps?  A way to sell Apple&#8217;s over-hyped and underused applications like Pages for iPad?</p>
<p>We are the App Store, and Apple will lose out if they don&#8217;t respect that.  As a developer of web and iOS applications, taking away my freedom by forcing me to use Apple&#8217;s subscription system is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Both Apple and Google have demonstrated that they want to be the only source of commercial apps for their platform.  Now they&#8217;re telling us how to do business at a fundamental level, and taking a cut of our income.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2761-launch-basecamp-mobile">37signals made a web app instead of native apps</a> for Basecamp.  I thought a native Basecamp app sounded like a fun project and couldn&#8217;t understand why they made this move, but now it looks like a wise decision.  They have a usable app, on devices with built-in wireless connectivity, without having to give a dime to Google, Apple, or anybody else.  How many more companies are going to move to elegant HTML5 web experiences to escape the control of Apple?</p>
<p>The most galling statement I&#8217;ve read on this topic is that app developers have had a free lunch so far.  Excuse me?  How many of us invested weeks or months to study Apple&#8217;s (relatively unique) choice of language, and closed APIs?  How many of us paid our mandatory iOS developer fee?  How many of us have had apps rejected for obscure reasons?  And before the Apple apologists start arguing about App Store rejections &#8212; I work (freelance) for a music streaming service, and believe me when I say there&#8217;s nothing <em>fair</em> about Apple&#8217;s review policies.</p>
<p>I love developing with Apple&#8217;s operating systems and tools, but people are surprisingly fickle and will dump their iPhones quicker than Apple are prepared for.  We make the App Store what it is, and the future of it is in our hands.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>&#8220;And in practice again, I observe.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of crime dramas over the last few years.  As a Sherlock Holmes fan, it&#8217;s easy to spot the homages to Conan Doyle&#8217;s influential character.  One of the qualities espoused by modern TV crime drama is <em>attention to detail</em>.  A famous example, and perhaps the origin of this character trope, is Holmes&#8217; beyond-autistic ability to read deductions from mundane facts.</p>
<p>In this scene, Watson is surprised that Holmes knew he had recently been walking through the rain, even though it was days ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It is simplicity itself,&#8221; said he; &#8220;my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;My dear Holmes, this is too much!&#8221;</h3>
<p>In <em><span class="caps">CSI</span></em>, Grissom also offers several keen insights that warrant the surprise of his own colleagues.  In his line of work, attention to detail isn&#8217;t just beneficial, it&#8217;s critical.</p>
<p>But what does attention to detail <em>really</em> mean?  Does it mean we should keenly observe everything around us at all times?  We can&#8217;t possibly mentally record the minutiae of everything we experience.</p>
<h3>Attention to Detail is not Everything</h3>
<p>Attention to detail is not <strong>everything</strong>.  It sometimes feels that way &#8212; when I start a new project I have all the good intentions in the world.  I promise myself that <em>this</em> project will be perfect, and I&#8217;ll do everything right from the start.</p>
<p>Even so, that doesn&#8217;t tell me what attention to detail means in the context of what I do.  It seems like something that should be useful; and a positive attribute for potential hires or collaborators.  Grissom tries to trip up new employees with riddles, he knows what qualities he&#8217;s looking for in a colleague.</p>
<h3>New Project Syndrome</h3>
<p>Most of us start new projects with a level of excitement that isn&#8217;t sustained through the life of the project.  At first the possibilities seem endless, but as the project evolves doors start to close.  This is caused by clients or our own solutions to technical or design problems.  As the excitement wanes, so does the quality of the work.</p>
<p>Being aware of the level of attention to detail applied to a given project helps flag up when projects are starting to fatigue.  But that still doesn&#8217;t explain what attention to detail means.</p>
<h3>&#8220;This is indeed a mystery,&#8221; I remarked. &#8220;What do you imagine that it means?&#8221;</h3>
<p>Holmes replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where can we find <em>data</em> about attention to detail?  As a source of inspiration, I looked through some <a href="https://github.com/alexyoung/wingman/commits/master/">commit logs</a> of an open source project I&#8217;m working on.  It made me realise how many small commits I&#8217;ve had to make to fix obscure bugs or add very minor features that greatly improve the usability of the application.</p>
<p>I was reflecting on this when I thought, &#8220;the attention to detail required to build such a simple application is ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just a question of building the application, it was a question of <em>building it well</em>.  Anyone can build these things, but it takes a lot of thought and care to get the keen insights required to make it <em>good</em>, let alone great.</p>
<p>The next time you put off tiny changes, in search of bigger bugs and major features, ask yourself this: are these the tiny changes really the attention to detail that will take this project from being good to great?  Context is everything &#8212; only you can know the difference between wheat and chaff when it comes to your own projects.</p>
<p>It was easy for me to generate lists of changes for the aforementioned open source project because I use it daily.  If you&#8217;re not in a position to generate these observations, they may come from healthy client relationships.  I like to stay in touch with clients and talk to them regularly.  Another approach is to set yourself a goal of regular updates &#8212; try to make small improvements to a project every day rather than bunching up marathons of work.</p>
<p>As Holmes says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of a certain popular to-do list app for Mac OS.  But I&#8217;ve stopped using it because I&#8217;ve made an open source replacement called <a href="http://github.com/alexyoung/wingman/">Wingman</a>.  You can download it and install it on your computer or server.  Alternatively, try it out on <a href="http://wingman.heroku.com/">wingman.heroku.com</a>.  I can&#8217;t promise you won&#8217;t lose data on the Heroku instance, so treat it as a demo version.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s built with OpenID, Rails 3, MongoDB, and jQuery UI.  The interface closely follows the Mac app that I&#8217;ve clearly been inspired by, but has Gmail-style keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>I started working on it about 2 months ago.  I built the basic version completely in JavaScript while drinking too much over a rainy weekend.  It still only really has one page, and saves everything through a Rails app&#8217;s <span class="caps">JSON</span> <span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not finished yet, and there are a lot of glitches, but feel free to fork it and submit patches if you like it enough.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>I&#8217;m working on an open source project that uses Rails 3, <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, <a href="http://mongoid.org/">Mongoid</a>, and OpenID.  I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://github.com/pelle/ruby-openid">ruby-openid</a>, and whilst it has example code it&#8217;s not exactly easy to get to grips with.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using OpenID for authentication because I want to create a series of open source projects that use a bunch of interesting technologies like Rails 3 and Node, yet are simple to deploy on cheap hosting services like <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="http://www.joyent.com/technology/smartplatform/introduction-to-node-js/">Joyent</a>.  I want people to be able to easily install instances of these projects and authenticate without registering, and perhaps have the option of paying to use a commercial deployment that I might run.</p>
<p>The reason I mention it is ruby-openid was behaving strangely on Heroku with in-memory storage.  The file system module worked fine locally.  Here&#8217;s some context:</p>

</div><p>In this case <code>Module</code> could be <code>Filesystem</code> or <code>Memory</code>.  Heroku doesn&#8217;t allow filesystem writes, so I thought it would be nice to use Mongo instead.  I put some slapdash code together and it worked pretty well: <a href="http://gist.github.com/601236">db_store.rb</a>.</p>
<p>Most people use plugins like <a href="http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic">authlogic</a> which optionally support OpenID.  I wanted to avoid the plugin dependency because these open source mini-projects I&#8217;m building don&#8217;t have any other login options.  The reason for this is I want the server-side code to be incredibly light, so the server basically acts as a way to safely save <span class="caps">JSON</span> data.</p>
<p>Client-heavy, OpenID-powered apps that are easy to install on cloud services.  That&#8217;s my motivation.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Mongoid and OpenID, you might be able to use <a href="http://gist.github.com/601236">db_store.rb</a>.  You could even improve it and release it!</p>
<h3>Meanwhile, in Tokyo</h3>
<p><img src="/images/tokyo-night.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I went to the <a href="http://www.mobalean.com/blog/2010/09/02/announcing-tokyo-rubyist-meetup">Tokyo Rubyist Meetup</a>.  Contrary to popular belief, I don&#8217;t travel the world going to programmer meet-ups.  It was actually my wife who arranged it &#8212; she&#8217;s not a programmer, she worked with one of the organisers when translating <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>.  It was a good event for her to attend, because the idea behind it was to get Japanese programmers talking with English-speaking people to get translation help, and also encourage more interaction between the communities.</p>
<p>I met a lot of interesting developers, both Japanese and from just about everywhere else.  I was a little bit envious of the foreigners working in Japan &#8212; the language barrier is difficult of course, but I love trying to learn Japanese.  I&#8217;m convinced my body was engineered to survive on Japanese food, because it seems to agree with me more than Western food.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tgs.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>While we were there we also went to <span class="caps">TGS</span>.  I got to play Fallout New Vegas, of which I&#8217;m a big fan (I lost nearly 100 hours to Fallout 3).  There was an amusing booth for the 龍が如く games, featuring a guy with makeup who looked a lot like a zombie.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing happened in Japan &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/rowland">one of my closest friends</a> flew over from Hong Kong.  We took him to some of Tokyo&#8217;s big toy and comic shops, and he seemed to have a knack for finding Star Wars-related stuff.</p>
<p>I managed to avoid talking about the trip on Twitter, because I&#8217;m still convinced announcing &#8220;I&#8217;M ON <span class="caps">HOLIDAY</span>!&#8221; on social networks is a bad idea.  So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been quiet!</p>
<p>There are more photos on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alex_young/sets/72157624956432840/">Japan 2010</a> set at Flickr.  Somehow my iPhone photos came out better than my real camera, I&#8217;m not sure if serendipity was at work or if the new iPhone has magical camera powers.</p><div class="feedflare">

I&#8217;ve never been to one before, but one of my open source and commercial collaborators (<a href="http://twitter.com/sstarr">@sstarr</a>) saw John Gruber on the lineup and demanded we go.  I don&#8217;t really know much about Gruber, other than he&#8217;s an Apple blogger, so my excuse was after party shenanigans.</p>
<h3>Marty Neumeier: The Designful Company</h3>
<p><img src="/images/dconstruct/marty.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Neumeier&#8217;s talk was about using design to differentiate companies, products, and further their potential.  He highlighted the unexpected way products that test poorly go on to succeed, and gave examples of products that failed because they were <em>different and bad</em>, or succeeded because they were <em>different but good</em>.</p>
<h3>Brendan Dawes: Boil, Simmer, Reduce</h3>
<p><img src="/images/dconstruct/dawes.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen Dawes speak a few times, so I thought I might be about to see the same talk again.  But fortunately this one was pretty fresh.  He used his trademark interactive slides to illustrate some points, and drew on recent work.  A great example of this was his <a href="http://movie-peg.com/">MoviePeg</a> project.  I&#8217;ve seen this project before but I didn&#8217;t realise he started it.  It came from one of those serendipitous moments when he was on a train trying to prop up his iPhone to watch a movie.</p>
<p>What really fascinated me was Dawes&#8217; assertion that building physical products now has an incredibly low barrier to entry.  In the case of MoviePeg, they worked with an industrial design company who sent them <span class="caps">CAD</span> files they couldn&#8217;t even open, but they found ways around that and managed to get a solid prototype created.  He mentioned <a href="http://www.ponoko.com/">Ponoko</a>, which is a service that helps you create amazing things yourself.  I was also reminded of <a href="http://sugru.com/">Sugru</a>, which I&#8217;ve been dying to order to create something similar to MoviePeg (I want a way of hanging my mobile phone on the wall to make it a better alarm clock.)</p>
<h3>David McCandless: Information is Beautiful</h3>
<p><img src="/images/dconstruct/david.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>McCandless demonstrated how he communicates difficult concepts through infographics, and explored the relationships of data and how to make data <em>usable</em>.  He also explained how he comes up with ideas, and how he creates his infographics through tools like Google Insights.</p>
<p>He said one of the biggest failures of designers is losing a sense of play.  I feel like this is true for programmers as well.  I think the question of <em>how to play</em> as a developer is an interesting one, and probably isn&#8217;t best answered with &#8220;StarCraft II&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Negative feelings are good sources of inspiration (boredom, ignorance, frustration, bewilderment)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25541021@N00/">McCandless&#8217; Flickr account</a> has tonnes of great examples of his work.  He also said he did a <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/david_mccandless.html"><span class="caps">TED</span> talk</a> that was very similar to his dConstruct talk.</p>
<h3>Samantha Warren: The Power and Beauty of Typography</h3>
<p><img src="/images/dconstruct/warren.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Typography doesn&#8217;t mystify me, even though I&#8217;m typically a developer, but I actually learned something useful in this talk.  Warren didn&#8217;t discuss anything particularly deep technically, but instead connected emotion and fashion to choices in typography.</p>
<p>This was a good lesson for me, because I always choose typefaces based on a technical reason &#8212; this type will reproduce well in a small size which suits this project.  But Warren said we should see letters in a different way, and consider the emotional value of our choices to try to evoke an emotional reaction.  This might sound pretty abstract to an application developer like me, but even the applications we build have marketing sites and possibly even associated printed material.</p>
<h3>John Gruber: The Auteur Theory of Design</h3>
<p><img src="/images/dconstruct/gruber.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what to expect from Gruber.  I was really hoping the Apple references would be minimal, just because I wanted to see what else he had to say.  His talk was about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur_theory">auteur directors</a>, and their place and value in the world of cinema.</p>
<p>It was insightful that Gruber referenced auteur directors to explain why certain technology products and companies are successful.  This was clearly inspired by Steve Jobs, but the talk was thoughtfully presented and well-researched.  It had more of an academic tone than I expected.</p>
<h3>James Bridle: The Value of Ruins</h3>
<p><img src="/images/dconstruct/bridle.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Bridle walks backwards and forward a lot when he speaks.  You have no idea how hard that photo was to take.  Regardless of his animated stage presence, his talk had a good balance of humour and more serious subjects.  He started by discussing his &#8220;home town&#8221; &#8212; the place of his major coming-of-age experiences &#8212; which turned out to be GeoCities.  It was a great opening gambit which drew uproarious laughter from the audience.</p>
<p>His talk was really about the loss and history of information.  At some stages of human history entire cultures have been lost through carelessness or on purpose.  In contrast, projects like Wikipedia track every single change in a document, a level of tracking that hasn&#8217;t happened before.</p>
<h3>Hannah Donovan: What Improvisation Can Teach Us About Design</h3>
<p><img src="/images/dconstruct/hannah.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Donovan&#8217;s talk began with a live jam session.  It was unexpected and came at the perfect time during the day &#8212; just as people had started to fatigue it felt refreshing.  In a previous life I was a musician, so her talk resonated with me.</p>
<h3>Tom Coates: Everything the Network Touches</h3>
<p><img src="/images/dconstruct/coates.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This was the talk that I took the most notes on.  Coates covered &#8220;transformative infrastructures&#8221; &#8212; from ancient history, through the industrial revolution, to the future.</p>
<p>He explored the importance of making real-world objects identifiable by services, and how open web standards might be important, but an open standard for identifying objects would be far more useful.  This example was backed up by examples of current projects, like a car parking system in San Fransisco that optimises parking using sensors.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spime">Spimes</a> were mentioned, a concept proposed by author Bruce Sterling.</p>
<p>In particular I liked this slide:</p>
<p><img src="/images/dconstruct/death.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It might seem fashionable to deride the semantic web, but there&#8217;s a reason why I agreed with Coates.  I have a good friend who worked for the better part of the last 10 years on semantic web technology, and he more than anyone would agree with that slide.</p>
<h3>Merlin Mann &#8211; Kerning, Organisms, and Those Goddamned Japanese Toothpicks</h3>
<p><img src="/images/dconstruct/mann.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe Mann was trying to insult Japanese toothpicks, it&#8217;s an obscure reference that takes a bit of explaining.  It was a metaphor about nerds, and how we&#8217;re all nerds in some way, and this is important to the perception of design, designers, and the things they make.</p>
<p>Mann presented his talk with no slides, in a way that was clearly intended to evoke stand-up comedy.  At times he sounded aggressive, but his punchlines and arguments were always just right.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>2010&#8217;s dConstruct felt like the connoisseur&#8217;s choice of web conferences.  The scheduling was perfect, particularly the musical interlude and Mann as the last talk.  It attracted a good audience too &#8212; a balance of geeks and designers.</p>
<p>The after-party was great fun, and some of us somehow kept the party going until the first train back to London (I fell asleep and nearly missed my stop).  I managed to have an interesting discussion with Ryan Carson about hats and tweed, so I&#8217;m now looking forward to the Future of Web Hats.</p><div class="feedflare">

I originally started using Sphinx itself because one client has hundreds of thousands of fairly large articles, and Sphinx could index them the fastest (in something like 10 minutes on the hardware we use).</p>
<p>The major downside is Thinking Sphinx, which appeared to make Rails incredibly slow in development mode.  It was unusably slow, even on fast multicore machines.  I thought the problem was mine for a long time (I&#8217;ve been using this for nearly 2 years), but I studiously kept Sphinx up to date and occasionally peered at the internals.  I added a flag to allow me to turn off Sphinx when I didn&#8217;t need it to speed up development mode, after I tried running the project without Sphinx (not loading the gem and stubbing <code>define_index</code>).</p>
<p>After looking through the source, I found the <code>load_models</code> which appeared to reload every single model.  This happens on every request in development mode.  The reason it does this is to find models that need Sphinx, then handle them appropriately.</p>
<p>This is one of those cases where too much Ruby magic is a bad thing.  I would have been fine with creating configuration statements to declare the models I use &#8212; I can cope with extra configuration, but not unusably slow development mode requests.</p>
<p>I created a <code>config/initializers/sphinx.rb</code> file and overrode <code>load_models</code>:</p>

<p>After searching for references to this, I found <a href="http://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx/issues/closed#issue/90">issue 90: Slow model load in development mode</a>.  Pat Allan responded to the issue and said the plugin will get configuration options for models in <code>sphinx.yml</code> for 1.3.18 or 1.4.0.</p>
<h3>Hidden Start Up Time</h3>
<p>Many Rails performance tools were actually saying this project is fast, because they miss the Rails boot up time.  Database queries, view code, controller code, models &#8212; all more or less benchmarked and iterated on at some point.  Rails start up time &#8212; invisible.  That&#8217;s when you need perftools, DTrace or similar.</p>
<h3>Why Slow?</h3>
<p>I ran <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/">perftools</a> and looked at the graphs to figure out why loading all the models made it so slow.  It&#8217;s obvious loading over 100 models wouldn&#8217;t help with performance, but why such a dramatic performance drop?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh"><span class="c"># You might need perftools for Ruby</span>
gem install perftools.rb

<span class="c"># From the project&#39;s Rails directory:</span>
<span class="nv">CPUPROFILE</span><span class="o">=</span>/tmp/rre <span class="nv">RUBYOPT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;-r`gem which perftools | tail -1`&quot;</span> ruby script/server

<span class="c"># Run apache bench in a new shell</span>
ab -c 10 -n 50 http://0.0.0.0:3000/

<span class="c"># Generate a report</span>
pprof.rb --text --ignore<span class="o">=</span>Gem /tmp/rre
pprof.rb --gif /tmp/rre &gt; ~/Desktop/rre.gif
</code></pre>
</div><p>I originally got this method from <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2009/06/13/profiling-ruby-with-googles-perftools/">Profiling Ruby With Google&#8217;s Perftools</a>.  You&#8217;ll need graphviz installed if you want to generate graphs.</p>
<p>Looking over the graph, I could see the following performance hogs:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>garbage_collector</code></li>
	<li><code>Module#load_file</code></li>
	<li><code>Module#search_for_file</code></li>
	<li><code>Module#define_method</code></li>
	<li><code>Object#load_without_new_constant_marking</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I compared it to a graph of the project without Thinking Sphinx, and these dropped significantly.  It seems like simply loading all of the models is hard work because loading files is IO bound.  But the biggest difference is the garbage collector, which goes from 23% to 53% when using Thinking Sphinx.  Loading all of these models, parsing them, then not doing anything with them forces the garbage collector (in this version of <span class="caps">MRI</span>) to do more work.</p>

<h3>Ruby Performance: You&#8217;re Holding it Wrong</h3>
<p>A lot of people think Ruby is slow, but to my knowledge most dynamic languages have similar performance problems.  JavaScript has benefited from running in every browser on the planet, and the subsequent speed wars between browser builders, and it&#8217;s also a fundamentally easier language to parse.  But as the performance of Ruby 1.9, jRuby, and MacRuby all start to creep up on competing languages, it seems clear that if something is slow, it&#8217;s probably your software&#8217;s fault somewhere.</p>
<p>If your Rails project is slow, try looking at the source of your third-party code, and use performance tools where possible.  Don&#8217;t just assume Ruby is slow because you&#8217;ve heard <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> is hot (although it is hot).  In fact, Ruby and performance reminds me of Apple and the iPhone 4 antenna.</p>

I used to do it like this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Assume I&#8217;m awesome</li>
	<li>Rush in and make something</li>
	<li>Waste a lot of time getting basics wrong</li>
	<li>Eventually learn how to do things properly the hard way</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a particularly productive way of working.  After learning a few languages we assume we can pick up new ones pretty quickly, but overconfidence can lead to big problems.</p>
<p>Shortly after this era I entered <em>The Age of the Unwieldy Tome</em>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>I&#8217;d buy a few books about a topic</li>
	<li>Barely read them</li>
	<li>Realise most of them were garbage</li>
	<li>Rush in the same way as before</li>
</ol>
<p>After over a decade of programming I now learn new languages a different way.  The key thing is to efficiently build up an overall picture of the platform and language.  Not down to the <span class="caps">API</span> method level, but an awareness of the various structures applications can take, and the capabilities of the major APIs.</p>
<p>Then I figure out how to make the <span class="caps">IDE</span> or my editor do what they need to do: how do I run an app in debug mode?  What debug options are there?  For example, if the language isn&#8217;t garbage collected how do I get good stack traces for memory-related crashes?</p>
<p>Next I start building toy apps that I&#8217;ll probably delete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll search sites like GitHub for real projects, and try to build up a picture of who writes good code and why.  Reading real code from open source projects and libraries can get you up to speed quickly.</p>
<h3>An Inkling</h3>
<p>The first stage is the most important &#8212; becoming familiar with application structure and available APIs.  By taking time to read things and not rushing into real work, I&#8217;ll be in a good position to tell when something is wrong.  When writing iPhone apps in the early days I used to get a feeling that anything that looked synchronous was a bad idea, and because I&#8217;d surfed through Apple&#8217;s documentation I was aware of methods like <code>performSelectorInBackground</code>, and classes like <code>NSThread</code> and <code>NSNotification</code>.</p>
<p>When I originally learned Cocoa, Apple hadn&#8217;t yet rolled out garbage collection, so we had to be careful with retain counts.  I rushed into Cocoa development, so my early projects had some poor memory handling.  I&#8217;d missed an important convention: convenience class methods return <code>autoreleased</code> objects, so sometimes objects would get deallocated and I didn&#8217;t know why.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;d read through the documentation, even if I forgot this convention, I&#8217;d get an inkling that I&#8217;d seen the answer somewhere.</p>
<h3>Oblique Strategies for the Autodidact</h3>
<p>Next time you come to start a new language:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Try keeping your initial studies broad: get an overall picture of the landscape</li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t read too much detail early on to keep motivated</li>
	<li>Learn how to make the environment work effectively before writing code</li>
	<li>Find the best sources of documentation.  When you get the inkling something is wrong, plunder the docs</li>
	<li>Read other people&#8217;s code</li>
</ul>
<h3>This is Common Sense</h3>
<p>All of this is common sense, but it&#8217;s hard to formalise or structure learning new skills when we&#8217;re under pressure in a commercial (or even educational) environment.  It&#8217;s almost like we need a set of <em>Oblique Strategies</em> cards for programming.</p>
<p>How and why do you learn new languages?  Does it just happen because you&#8217;re landed with a project in a different language, or do you actively seek new languages and platforms to broaden your horizons?</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>It seemed like there were too many people covering CSS3 and HTML5.  They were really the hot technical topics of this event, which is fine but I&#8217;d like to have seem more JavaScript and mobile talks.  It might have been confusing for non-technical designers as well &#8212; <a href="http://molly.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a> said not to use CSS3 in production sites yet, whereas everyone else didn&#8217;t seem to care.</p>
<h3>Announcements</h3>
<p>Ryan Carson announced <a href="http://membership.thinkvitamin.com/">Think Vitamin Memberships</a>, which is a programme similar to <a href="http://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a>.  I liked the fact the video uses <em>Justice Phantom pt.2</em>, and they had Kid Robot giveaways for early registrations, so I caved.</p>
<h3>Talks</h3>
<p><img src="/images/fowd2010/sarah.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>One talk I enjoyed in particular was by <a href="http://www.youknowwhodesign.com/">Sarah Parmenter</a> who discussed iPhone interface design.  She covered the basics, but actually delved into some real app design issues.  Until now, I&#8217;ve never really fully appreciated how important the fingertip target sizes are.  I can think of a few apps that I&#8217;ve built where certain buttons and fields are too close together.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fowd2010/simon.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="http://colly.com/">Simon Collison&#8217;s</a> talk was entitled &#8220;What will Web Design Look Like in Two Years?&#8221; but avoided making any real predictions.  He did draw on examples like his homepage redesign, which gave the discussion some concrete grounding which I often feel lacks in design talks.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fowd2010/elliot.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com/">Elliot Jay Stocks</a> talked about promoting yourself.  Except he didn&#8217;t really, most of his talk was about running a small business.  What he discussed was immediately recognisable to me, as a freelancer/contractor/consultant.  He made some recommendations that really stuck in my head:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Treat money as a bi-product</li>
	<li>Find success without being driven by money</li>
	<li>Make things people care about rather than impressions/hits</li>
</ul>
<p>It reminded me of <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra&#8217;s</a> ideas about making useful things, whether they&#8217;re software or blog posts, to gain respect and success.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fowd2010/anna.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="http://maban.co.uk/">Anna Debenham</a> also talked about life as a freelancer.  Unlike several speakers, she had tonnes of meaty examples to back up her talk.  She also had beautiful and original handmade slides.  Ryan Carson said she was part of their initiative to find new speakers, but I think she must have put the fear of god into the older speakers.</p>
<p>Brett Welch&#8217;s talk, &#8220;Rethinking your Job&#8221;, covered similar business topics, but was equally applicable to agencies.  His main idea was to treat yourself as if you&#8217;re a subscription.  Rather than focusing on launching things, try to stick with clients and improve products over time.  This fits in well with what <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a> often say about launching early.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fowd2010/strange.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><a href="http://news.jam-factory.com/">Gavin Strange</a> talked about his life as a web designer, skateboarder, t-shirt designer, photographer, and toy creator.  His entire career is based around trying things out, without obsessing about techniques.</p>
<h3>Clinics</h3>
<p>I attended one of the design clinics.  These were a means of getting one-to-one with the speakers.  I enjoyed being able to do this, and I hope Carsonified include this at future events.</p>
<h3>Arcades</h3>
<p><img src="/images/fowd2010/qix.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The break room had arcades on freeplay.  I played tonnes of Qix,  I forgot how much I like that game!  The cabinets were nice Atari ones as well, not generic pub cabinets with <span class="caps">MAME</span>.</p>
<h3>Insert Credit to Continue?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard <span class="caps">FOWA</span> is going to be at the same venue, which is a good thing.  I was initially disappointed by FOWA&#8217;s lineup, and I&#8217;ve seen 80% of the speakers before so it&#8217;s a hard sell.  If you&#8217;re thinking about going and haven&#8217;t been to many Carsonified events before, you should have a great time.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>I revealed desktop earlier and was surprised to find a utilitarian utopia:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are no icons on the desktop</li>
	<li>The background image is simply grey</li>
	<li>There&#8217;s no Dock</li>
</ul>
<p>Concerned that obsessive-compulsive minimalism had kicked in, I tried to figure out why my office computer had ended up like this.</p>
<p>Certain projects of mine benefit from IM, but I can&#8217;t work productively with Adium or Skype&#8217;s icon blinking intermittently.  Rather than quit and load all the time, I hid the Dock.</p>
<p>I take a lot of screenshots of my products, and I also make videos to demo work to clients, which resulted in the grey desktop.  Accidentally capturing the content of my desktop background got annoying.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really work with many documents, and scrappy bits that I need to share get dragged to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> rather than the desktop.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.machinecodex.com/dateline/">DateLine</a> sits at the bottom of the screen so I can quickly work out appointments without needing to open iCal.</p><div class="feedflare">

<h3>JsChat: Mongo, Twitter Auth</h3>
<p>JsChat can now be configured to work with Mongo and Twitter authentication:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The web interface now has tabs</li>
	<li>The server now has a config file in <code>/etc/jschat/config.json</code></li>
	<li>The config file can be used to set up Twitter auth and Mongo</li>
	<li>Logging in with Twitter will save the user&#8217;s session (including tabs) until <em>Quit</em> is pressed or <code>/quit</code> is entered</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ico</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve removed the Prototype dependency from Ico, so it only depends on the core <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a> library.  I used jslint to help tidy up the code as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData"><span class="caps">SVG</span> paths</a> for drawing Ico&#8217;s graphs.  They&#8217;re quite easy to build because they&#8217;re simple strings:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="c">// Move to 0,0, draw a line to 10,10</span>
<span class="s1">&#39;M0,0 L10,10&#39;</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Raphael&#8217;s calls can be chained, so the resulting code is concise:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="c">// Move to 0,0, draw a line to 10,10, then apply a stroke</span>
<span class="nx">paper</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;M0,0 L10,10&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">attr</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="s1">&#39;stroke&#39;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">colour</span> <span class="p">});</span>
