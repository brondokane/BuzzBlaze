<p>Travel has always been a priority for me. I love seeing new places, experiencing new cultures, and just getting away from the routines of my daily life. Even more important, my family and close friends are a pretty far-flung crowd. I have loved ones spread from Boston to Buenos Aires. We buy a <i>lot</i> of plane tickets in my family. We buy so many tickets that I should have become savvy about how we buy them much earlier than I did.</p>
<p>For years, I&#8217;ve mainly just flown with <a href="http://www.jetblue.com/UBF/flights/flights.asp">JetBlue</a>. I use <a href="http://www.farecast.com">Farecast</a> to see if there&#8217;s a better deal available elsewhere. If there&#8217;s not a significantly cheaper ticket on that site, I buy my ticket through JetBlue. They generally have low fares and a good frequent-flyer program. This is a pretty simplistic approach. Since I&#8217;d never researched it carefully, I didn&#8217;t know if I was really getting the best deals on my travel.</p>
<p>Now, my best friend is moving to San Francisco. (Yes, between <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/12/29/pet-insurance-is-it-worth-the-cost/">losing my cat</a> and <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/01/06/drama-in-real-life-when-emergencies-pile-up/">my health problems</a> and my friend&#8217;s move, it&#8217;s been a doozy of a month). I&#8217;m suddenly looking at traveling a lot more than I already do! Figuring out how to squeeze a few trips a year to the West Coast into my budget is a challenge. Before I overhaul my other spending areas, I wanted to find out if I could get more travel for the same amount I&#8217;m already spending. Maybe I can make my existing travel budget take me further &mdash; literally.</p>
<p>Maybe. As far as I can tell, there are two essential components to getting the best possible deals on air travel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding the lowest fares, and</li>
<li>Using rewards travel programs</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are complex tasks, fraught with potential pitfalls.</p>

<p></p>
<p><i><b>Finding Low Fares</b></i><br />
Finding the cheapest tickets is a clear starting place. Airlines compete with each other primarily on fares. Who would want to pay more for the same service? Of course you&#8217;ll buy the lowest fare you can find, all else being equal. Unfortunately, the golden age of finding cheap fares easily online is coming to an end. <i>The New York Times</i> recently published a fascinating story about <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/travel/08air.html">how airlines are pulling their fare listings</a> from sites like <a href="http://www.orbitz.com/">Orbitz</a> and <a href="http://www.expedia.com/default.asp">Expedia</a>. Some carriers, like JetBlue, are using new media like Twitter to advertise their best fares, which they sell only through their own websites.</p>
<div class="highlight"><i><b>Tip:</b></i> To find those sweet JetBlue specials, follow <a href="http://twitter.com/JetBlueCheeps">@JetBlueCheeps</a>.</div>
<p></p>
<p>To find the best fares, the <i>New York Times</i> recommends starting with <a href="http://www.itasoftware.com/">ITA software</a>, a small company that provides the technological background for a number of popular travel sites. You can cover your bases to find deals they may have missed by also checking out meta-sites like <a href="http://www.kayak.com/">Kayak.com</a> and <a href="http://www.farecompare.com/">FareCompare.com</a>. Another site the <i>New York Times</i> says is worth checking out is <a href="http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/">AirfareWatchdog.com</a>, where real people collect information about cheap fares, sometimes catching special deals the bigger, automated sites have missed.</p>
<p>If you care about features other than price, you may want to pay a visit to <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com/">Hipmunk.com</a>, which uses an &#8220;agony index&#8221; to help you find the best value on a flight, taking into account not only price but duration and number of stops.</p>

<p></p>
<p><i><b>Using Rewards Travel Programs</b></i><br />
Once you&#8217;ve found your airfares, there&#8217;s the question of how you&#8217;ll pay for them. Will you just reach into your wallet for cold hard cash, or try to deploy one of the many &#8220;travel rewards&#8221; programs out there. I&#8217;ve always done the former, and am now starting to explore the latter.</p>
<p><b>Travel rewards programs aren&#8217;t exactly as free as they might at first appear.</b> They seem to come in basically two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequent-flyer rewards programs run by a particular airline to reward customer loyalty, and</li>
<li>Credit-card rewards programs that let you earn miles to be used on any airline.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mentioned that I&#8217;ve used JetBlue&#8217;s frequent flyer program. They recently changed it to a points system not unlike the credit card travel rewards program.</p>
<p>In essence, rewards programs award you points for miles traveled or dollars spent. Once you&#8217;ve accumulated a certain number of points, you earn either a free flight or a voucher towards a ticket on the airline of your choosing. Most credit card reward programs are designed with a $1 = 1 point system. <img src="http://www.getrichslowly.org/images/iStock_creditandcash.jpg" width="200" height="129" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" alt="Rewards programs can turn your spending into cash. Sort of." title="Rewards programs can turn your spending into cash. Sort of." />In general, travel-related expenses like airfares, hotel stays, car rentals and restaurants earn double points. You can also find even better deals if you hunt around. My bank has a rewards program that will give my husband <i>three</i> points for every dollar he spends with his bank credit card, as a reward for also having a checking account with the same bank.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll need those extra points if he wants to earn a travel reward, because the threshold for getting a $200 airfare voucher is 41,000 points. Even at the triple points rate, we&#8217;d have to spend $15,000 to earn one one-way ticket from Boston to San Francisco. JetBlue&#8217;s deal with American Express is a little better, offering up to 8 points per dollar spent if I buy my tickets through Jet Blue. Even so, I&#8217;d have to spend well over $10,000 to earn a free flight cross country.</p>
<p>At first those numbers seemed prohibitively high. Then I looked at how much my household spends each month on living expenses. If I funneled all that money through one of these rewards credit cards, I&#8217;d get two or three reward tickets a year. That&#8217;s not as good a return on my &#8220;investment&#8221; as I was hoping, but doing it through my bank&#8217;s program doesn&#8217;t cost me a thing. <b>I spend that money anyway; I may as well get the travel coupons!</b></p>
<p>Getting a rewards credit card is a more complicated proposition. The interest rates are higher than I&#8217;m used to: in the mid-teens even for someone with excellent credit. They carry an annual fee of around $40-$50 as well. If I&#8217;m going to use a rewards credit card, I need it to really pay for itself.</p>
<p>To make things even more complicated, there&#8217;s now a website, <a href="http://www.points.com">Points.com</a>, that lets consumers exchange points from frequent flyer and  consumer rewards programs. You can log in for free and swap your JetBlue travel points with points in American Airlines frequent-flyer program or a few other airlines. That expands your options when searching for  the lowest fares: you&#8217;re less likely to have to choose between taking the very lowest fare and paying a little more for an airline you&#8217;re  building frequent flyer credit with.</p>
<p><i><b>Getting Started with Travel Hacking</b></i><br />
I plan to route most of my household expenses through my bank&#8217;s existing rewards program, taking advantage of that three-points-per-dollar rate. I decided to try JetBlue&#8217;s rewards AmEx deal for my travel purchases because I usually fly with them, and the way they couple the rewards program with their frequent-flyer program makes it likely I&#8217;ll get a benefit from it. If I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll cancel the card next year.</p>
<p>The effort I put in to maxing out my travel dollars might bring huge rewards. Hopefully in the form of plane tickets to San Francisco to see my friend and her family. But it will clearly cost me some substantial time and brain power. I&#8217;m going to try it for a year, and see if it pays off. My hunch right now is that just traveling on JetBlue and using their rewards program may well be nearly as cost effective, with far fewer hassles.</p>

<p>I’ve been working with a lot of people lately who can’t tell when enough is enough. Termed “Princesses”, these babes have a sense that they can have whatever they want, whenever they want it. And while people might look at them dumb-struck at their sense of entitlement, there are more of them than you might guess.</p>
<p>When I ask people why they buy stuff, they tell me it’s because they need it &mdash; whatever <i>IT</i> is. But that’s not always true. In fact, that’s hardly ever true. Fact is, many people don’t <i>need</i> most of the stuff they buy &mdash; they <i>want</i> it.</p>
<p><b>It’s easy to confuse needs with wants.</b> You work hard and deserve nice things, right? Whether you’re thinking about buying a big-ticket item (we need a vacation) or smaller impulse purchases (I need a double-tall latte with Venetian chocolate), your sense of entitlement can muddy the waters when it comes to what you want and what you really need.</p>
<p>Where do you suppose our sense of entitlement comes from?</p>
<p><b>People who are raised in North America may have a sense of entitlement simply because <a href="http://www.globalrichlist.com/">they have no idea how lucky they are</a>.</b> If you’ve never been hungry, never wondered where you would sleep, never had to go without shoes, then your sense of what is by rights your due may be askew. </p>
<p>If every winter your family went on vacation to a warmer clime, if every summer you went to camp, if each fall you started the new school year with a fresh wardrobe and all the school supplies you could imagine, why would you think you were entitled to any less as an adult? Even if you haven’t got the income to support it, you have no idea why you can’t have everything you want when you want it. And if you’ve been handed a pile of credit, no doubt you’ll satisfy your sense of entitlement, damn the long-term costs.</p>
<p>People who watch a lot of TV, read flashy magazines and walk the malls have a sense of entitlement because they come to believe that “everyone else has one so I want one too.” But if everyone else is going into debt to have the lifestyle you crave, then what you’re craving isn’t real &mdash; it’s smoke and mirrors. <b>Playing the <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/03/25/waving-good-bye-to-the-joneses/">keeping-up-with-the-Joneses game is stupid</a> at the best of times, but it’s suicidal if you’re doing it on credit.</b></p>
<p>Just look at <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/11/17/how-much-house-do-you-need/">the size of the houses we’re living in</a> now compared to those our parents were raised in. In 1974, people were having more kids (the average American family size was 3.1 people vs. 2.6 people in 2004) but living in houses far smaller than we’re willing to settle for today (the average home was 1695 square feet, but it was 2349 square feet in 2004). And only the rich and famous could afford granite counters and marble floors. Now we want a room for every child, plus a living room, family room, media room, and kids’ playroom. And if we have to share a television, we’re hard-done-by.  Unfortunately, as our expectations have gone up, our ability to pay for them has been seriously challenged.</p>
<p>While we like to castigate the younger generation for their rampant sense of entitlement, it’s not just a problem of youth and immaturity. Look at the words that have arisen to describe our sense of entitlement: words like “consumerism” and “<a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/11/12/are-you-a-shopaholic-six-steps-to-curb-compulsive-spending/">shopaholic</a>” and “<a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&#038;t=3244&#038;start=0">affluenza</a>” and “selfish capitalism” and “consumercide” and the counter “sustainable living”.</p>
<p>Have we become so addicted to <i>having</i> (instead of <i>being</i>) that we&#8217;re no longer able to distinguish between needs and wants? Is acquisition of more <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/09/07/further-adventures-in-my-war-on-stuff/">Stuff</a> our new life’s blood?</p>
<p>If you had to pick one day of the week on which you will buy nothing, how hard would that be for you? How much planning does it take? How addicted to shopping are you?</p>

<p>During the 1990s, my financial life was like a Caribbean cruise ship during hurricane season: I was in a cabin at the center of the ship, unaware of the storms approaching from the horizon. By 2001, I&#8217;d wandered onto the deck in the midst of Hurricane Debt and Failure; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joiseyshowaa/1166989434/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1207/1166989434_d67720710d_m.jpg" width="240" height="172" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" alt="Flexo's life was like a storm at sea. Photo by joseyshowaa." title="Flexo's life was like a storm at sea. Photo by joseyshowaa." /></a>I found myself in financial and personal trouble. It took a few years, but eventually I discovered that I had more control over that cruise ship than I thought. </p>
<p>In 2006, I shared with Get Rich Slowly readers the <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/11/15/you-inc-how-to-be-the-cfo-of-your-own-life/">circumstances that allowed me to start moving in the right direction</a>. In short, I realized that I could no longer sit by and let external forces &mdash; the hurricanes: my bosses, a difficult situation at work, my increasing debt, a deteriorating personal relationship &mdash; control my life. I learned how to manage my own money, using the basic approaches of <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/11/10/make-more-money-how-to-supercharge-your-income/">earning more</a> and <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/01/31/conscious-spending-in-action/">spending smarter</a>. I removed the negative forces in my life &mdash; anything that worked against my long-term goals to improve my finances, my life, and my identity &mdash; and replaced them with positives. </p>
<p>In my old life, I put the blame for failure or the credit for success on outside forces, such as luck or the economy. But this just made me feel helpless about my situation. In my new life, <b>I shifted my philosophy from an external locus of control to an <i>internal</i> one: the belief that the circumstances in my life were due to choices I made.</b> (Or worse, the choices I <i>didn&#8217;t</i> make.) This made all the difference.</p>
<p><em><strong>Taking the Red Pill</strong></em><br />
While working for a company in the finance industry, I learned how large public corporations operate. I began to apply some of these lessons at home; I started looking at myself as <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/11/15/you-inc-how-to-be-the-cfo-of-your-own-life/">the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of my own life</a>. </p>
<p>Like a public company, I published regular reports of my financial progress online. I didn&#8217;t do this to brag; in fact, at first there was more embarrassment than anything else. Holding myself accountable to Consumerism Commentary readers was a good move for me, and almost eight years later after my first post in 2003, I still publish these monthly reports and field questions and suggestions from readers. (<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/personal-balance-sheet-january-2011/">Here&#8217;s the first monthly report of 2011.</a>)</p>
<div align="center"><img src="http://www.getrichslowly.org/images/flexobs.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" title="Flexo's personal financial statements" /></div>
<p></p>
<p>In December, after building a business on the side that could more than sustain me, I quit my corporate job and shifted exclusively to writing and developing my own online projects. I&#8217;ve been tracking my discoveries working for no boss other than myself in a series called &#8220;<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/life-after-salary/">Life After Salary</a>&#8220;. </p>
<p>The path I chose may not be for you. But the concept of being the CFO of your own life applies to <i>everyone</i>. <b>You have to make choices if you want to live your life a certain way rather than let life happen to you.</b> The best way to describe this feeling of awakening is to compare it with the moment in the film <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a></em> where Neo, the &#8220;One,&#8221; can at last see the Matrix for what it is, and realizes he can control his environment. </p>
<p><b><i>You</i> are in control of your life, even if you work for someone else.</b> <i>You</i> choose whether to get out of bed in the morning, understanding the consequences if you don&#8217;t. <i>You</i> decide whether to take on the assignment your boss gives you. <i>You</i> either choose to be happy or not &mdash; every second of every day.</p>
<p>With my recent shift to self-employment, I discovered yet another level of control necessary to better reach my long-term goals, both financial and non-financial.</p>
<p><i><b>How to Be the CEO of Your Own Life</b></i><br />
In business, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is responsible for guiding a company towards its mission, vision, and goals. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) ensures the company manages its finances properly in order to reach those goals. In the business world, the CFO answers to the CEO. But in your own life, you need to play both roles.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to operate as the CEO of your own life:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take ownership.</strong> Sometimes people need to hit bottom before realizing they need to take control of their situation. But rock bottom isn&#8217;t a pretty place. Don&#8217;t wait for it. Start attributing your success and failures to the decisions <i>you</i> make (or don&#8217;t make), and you&#8217;ll see that there&#8217;s no need to let others control your life. When you&#8217;ve decided to stop taking orders from the world, to stop waiting for someone else to make your decisions, you&#8217;ll be promoting yourself from administrative assistant to boss.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Set goals.</strong> I like to set lofty non-financial goals to give my life direction. Dry financial goals are vacuous. What&#8217;s the point of having a goal of retiring at age 45 with $2 million in the bank? What will you do when you no longer have any work to keep you busy all day? Focus on the person you want to be, and what you would like your <i>New York Times</i> obituary to say &mdash; then you can figure out what your finances need to be in order to get there.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/22/track-every-penny-you-spend/">Track your finances.</a></strong> You know your destination, but you can&#8217;t set your course yet because you don&#8217;t know where you are. Know where you stand (your <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/09/11/net-worth-the-most-important-number-in-personal-finance/">net worth</a>) and your velocity (your income and expenses over time) so you can determine the right path for you. This requires some tools, whether software like Quicken or a pencil and pad.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Recruit a positive environment.</strong> Build a support team. I did this by creating a blog, but if you&#8217;re more normal, you may wish to share your goals with friends and family while keeping the gory details private. Escape the negative attitudes around you. &#8220;Negative energy&#8221; sounds a little new-agey, but there&#8217;s truth to the idea that people who bring you down emotionally will eventually become an obstacle to reaching your goals.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Make your own choices.</strong> Don&#8217;t wait for other people to tell you what to do. The worst thing that can happen is you refuse to make a choice because you don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s perfectly correct &mdash; as J.D. has said, <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/11/23/the-perfect-is-the-enemy-of-the-good-2/">the perfect is the enemy of the good</a>. Arm yourself with the best information you can find from sites like Get Rich Slowly, Consumerism Commentary, and other sources that work for you, as well as what you&#8217;ve learned from tracking your finances. Gather the essential tools like <a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/best-online-savings-accounts/">a great savings account</a> and a low-cost broker like Vanguard, and learn how to use them.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t let other things get in the way.</strong> CEOs and CFOs of large companies are focused on their responsibilities, and delegate all but the highest level of decisions. You don&#8217;t have the luxury to delegate, so don&#8217;t get distracted by anything that pulls you away from your mission. (But that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t have fun; life is short, and you need to live it now.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For every CEO or CFO that&#8217;s involved with a financial scandal, there are dozens who do great things for their organizations, build a company up from nothing, and make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>There was a time in my life when I wasn&#8217;t making any difference for myself, for my future. My finances suffered, my attitude suffered, and I was headed for imminent disaster. Now, <i>I</i> call the shots &mdash; all of them. I still have a lot of work to do and more to learn, but now I&#8217;m motivated by the idea that <b>whether I succeed or fail, it&#8217;s only the choices that I make that lead me to that point</b>. </p>
<p>When you&#8217;re the captain of your cruise ship and have the information and tools you need, you have the power to safely navigate through even the worst storms.</p>

Two years ago, Michael shared a guest post about <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/04/07/direct-stock-purchase-plans-a-better-way-to-invest/"><b>direct stock purchase plans</b></a>. Today, he shares his personal story, which is about sailing away from the American Dream.</i></p>
<p>I’m a healthy 42-year-old family man with a fine little house and a secure job with a salary that just made it over the six-digit milestone. I’m fortunate beyond measure, deep into the American Dream. <b>In a few months &mdash; if everything goes according to plan &mdash; my life as it is today will be gone:</b> I&#8217;ll be unemployed, another family will own our home, and the four of us will be on the road to Mexico in our Ford Escort station-wagon.</p>
<p>My wife and I did what we were supposed to &mdash; that’s how we got here. It’s where we set out to be. But four-and-a-half years ago, we decided we wanted something different. We came up with a five-year plan.</p>
<p><i><b>The Five-Year Plan</b></i><br />
At that time, we each spent 10 hours a day out of the house earning a paycheck. We came home tired from our work life and tended to the demands of our domestic life. Regrettably, kissing our girls goodnight was too often just another chore to complete: bedtime was done. Then we’d crash, get too little sleep, and wake to repeat the routine. To what end? Comfort? Security?</p>
<p>We decided to exit this well-worn path of comfort and security. <b>We wanted a lifestyle that afforded us time to coalesce as a family and the chance to expose our girls to something other than the rat race.</b> So we’re doing something radical to get both.</p>
<p>A few months ago &mdash; per our plan &mdash; we walked into a downtown Washington, D.C. bank, paid a $99 closing fee, and signed the papers needed to borrow $64,000 against the equity in our home. Days later, we wired that money to an escrow account in Washington state and closed on the purchase of a 32-year-old boat, sitting in Mexico. She’s 40 feet long, a sailboat, big enough to live on, stout enough to sail the oceans of the world.</p>
<p>Our planned lifestyle afloat will be as rich &mdash; if not richer, in many different ways &mdash; as our urban D.C. lifestyle, but will cost substantially less money (much less than <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/10poverty.shtml">the poverty level</a> for a family of four in the U.S.). We have enough equity remaining in our home (a fixer-upper we bought in 2001) to fund a life afloat for roughly five years.</p>
<p>Financial insanity? Absolutely. As I wrote, our planned path is not one of security. Yet we feel plenty financially secure.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/boatfortune.jpg" width="500" height="163" alt="Boats and water are in your future." title="Boats and water are in your future." /></div>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>Unconventional Financial Security</b></i><br />
How can we feel financially secure? By looking at this not as an early retirement, but as a job transition. I plan to follow my bliss and write full time, freelance. I’m moving from a very secure, well-paying, uninspiring job to one that is neither secure nor well-paying. Because we&#8217;re changing our lifestyle, our cost of living is plummeting with our income. Consider that we will start out with five years of living expenses in the bank, and things begin to look pretty rosy.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe rosy is a stretch. The main reason we both believe we can afford to make this radical lifestyle change is because <b>putting money away for retirement has been a focus of ours since before we were poor newlyweds</b>. When we launched our five-year plan, we further accelerated that funding, increasing our retirement account balances as much as possible. We don’t know how much money we’ll need when we reach the legislatively-defined retirement age in 25 years, but we don’t feel bound to continue working to contribute to that sum until our hair is white. We feel we’ve got a good start, given the time premium we gained by starting those accounts early and funding them aggressively.</p>
<p>By design, we didn’t conceive our plan to hinge on any specific financial goal or milestone; our departure isn’t tied to saving a specific amount of money. Instead, the five years we gave ourselves to save more money was arbitrary, but also considered the ages of our girls. Because our family is our motivation for making this change, and because the girls aren&#8217;t getting any younger, our timing is set in stone. We leave when five years is up, come hell or high water. I think that aspect of our plan is especially important. <b>It&#8217;s easy to find a reason to not follow through with a plan or goal that involves change</b>; there are always too many rational, logical, and often compelling reasons to stay the course. This is as true for a radical lifestyle change as it is for a commitment to go to the gym three times a week.</p>
<p>In fact, if our leaving depended on us having a specific amount of money saved, we wouldn’t be leaving as planned. Since committing to our five-year plan in 2006, the financial world imploded, seemingly led by our home’s value. Our original financial projections included about $100K more equity in our home than we have today. Our original boat budget was higher too.</p>
<p><i><b>The Age of the Radical Family</b></i><br />
The very fabric of our society is wrapped around a framework of rules and expectations. <b>The U.S. economy is based on the expectation that most of us are on the path our family is abandoning.</b> Our grandparents grew up in a world in which there were just a few well-worn paths from cradle to grave. And things have changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today, most employees are employed at-will.</li>
<li>Most are no longer covered by defined-benefit pension plans.</li>
<li>Many people 20 or more years from retirement don’t think they will see a full return of their lifetime Social Security contributions.</li>
<li>Most people self-direct funds to their retirement accounts and switch between several employers during the course of a career &mdash; or even start new careers.</li>
</ul>
<p>As our individual financial security has become more abstract, it’s given rise to a liberation, an increasing feeling among many that they can chart a different path through life. And can they ever!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/boatgirls.jpg" width="150" height="200" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" alt="The Robertson girls" title="The Robertson girls" />The Internet is filled with blogs of families who have charted a different course, taken a radical turn off the beaten path. Among this population, sailing around the world with kids is not uncommon; there are literally hundreds of families who have done it or are out there doing it. On our blog, <a href="http://www.logofdelviento.blogspot.com">Log of s/v Del Viento</a>, we list links to about a dozen out there now &mdash; each representing at least a dozen more families &mdash; and these are just the English speakers! Other families of similarly modest means have found their own way to do something radical. <a href="http://www.barenakedfamily.com/about_bnf/about_bnf.htm">The BareNaked Family</a> raised their kids on the road, and <a href="http://projectpragmatizo.blogspot.com/">the Podlesneys</a> are just setting out to do the same. <a href="http://www.familiesontheroad.com/">Families On The Road</a> is a gathering place for many more. Way off the beaten path is <a href="http://familyonbikes.org/blog/">the Vogel family</a>, just now nearing the end of their multi-year journey from Alaska to Patagonia &mdash; on bicycles. Their site is filled with links to other bicycling families.</p>
<p><b>More than any time in human history, and especially here in the United States, it makes sense to question assumptions and to consider alternatives.</b> Whether it&#8217;s sailing, RV trekking, bicycling, or something else, consider where you’d rather be and then consider working hard to get there, instead of wherever it is you’re working hard to get. Rest assured your financial life will be less certain, but you’ll still be getting rich slowly, richer in all the things that matter most.</p>
<div class="highlight"><i><b>J.D.&#8217;s note:</b></i> I wish my father were still alive to read this story. This was always a dream of his. But unlike Michael and his family, he never took the financial steps necessary to make his dream come true.</div>

<p><i><b>Studs Terkel&#8217;s Working</b></i><br />
Two years ago, I read and reviewed <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/04/11/hard-times-an-oral-history-of-the-great-depression/">Studs Terkel&#8217;s <i>Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression</i></a>, which featured excerpts from over 100 interviews the author conducted with those who lived through the 1930s. Terkel spoke with all sorts of people: old and young, rich and poor, famous and not-so-famous, liberal and conservative. These folks paint a picture of that era in their own words. <i>Hard Times</i> was fascinating.</p>
<p>Well, Terkel published a whole series of these oral histories, including a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565843428/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><i>Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do</i></a>. It&#8217;s sort of like a grown-up version of Richard Scarry&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394818237/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><i>What Do People Do All Day?</i></a>, one of my favorite books from childhood. In <i>Working</i> (published in 1974), Terkel collects stories from average joes and janes about what they do at their jobs, how they like it, and what they want to do in the future. For two years, I&#8217;ve been meaning to read this book, but I&#8217;ve never made time for it &mdash; until now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1595583211/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><img src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/working-cover.jpg" width="250" heigth="300" alt="Working by Studs Terkel, graphic adaptation directed by Harvey Pekar" title="Working by Studs Terkel, graphic adaptation directed by Harvey Pekar" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" /></a>At the end of January, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1595583211/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/">a graphic-novel adaptation of <i>Working</i></a> put together by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Pekar">Harvey Pekar</a>, who was best known as the writer of the autobiographical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Splendor"><i>American Splendor</i></a> comics (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APpxQm7sH5k">and movie</a>, a movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBv3TzH2jao">I love</a>). Working with a variety of illustrators, Pekar (and a handful of collaborators) adapted Terkel&#8217;s <i>Working</i> into graphic novel form. It&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>I truly believe, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9650060286/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/">the words of Brenda Ueland</a>, that <b>everyone is talented, original, and has something important to say</b>. To me, it&#8217;s the <i>personal</i> histories that make up History (by which I mean the grand tapestry of world events). Without your story &mdash; and mine &mdash; the larger story doesn&#8217;t exist. The mass movements of kingdoms and cultures are built on the backs of you and me.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that I love Studs Terkel&#8217;s work. Though he has an obvious progressive (or liberal) bias, so what? He gives everyone an equal say. In <i>Hard Times</i>, he gave voice to the residents of Depression-era shantowns <i>and</i> the stockbrokers who thought the whole thing was exaggerated. In <i>Working</i>, he does the same.</p>
<p><i><b>What Do People Do All Day?</b></i><br />
Here are a few excerpts from Pekar&#8217;s graphic-novel adaptation, which collects 28 stories from <i>Working</i>:</p>

<p><i><b>In Praise of Quotidian Life</b></i><br />
Don&#8217;t read <i>Working</i> &mdash; the original book or the graphic novel &mdash; if you&#8217;re expecting massive revelations about the human condition. You won&#8217;t find them here. <i>Working</i> is merely a mundane account of what it&#8217;s like to do a nine-to-five job. But that&#8217;s why I like it so much.</p>
<p>In the preface to the graphic novel, Harvey Pekar writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I was especially pleased to work on this project because Studs Terkel puts a great deal of emphasis, as I do, in writing about quotidian life. The so-called normal aspect of human existence is underemphasized in every form of literature, yet that is the aspect that most readers are familiar with and can most easily identify with.</p>
<p>The style of life I myself am familiar with is the quotidian.</p>
<p>But just because one writes about everyday life doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s uninteresting; in fact, I find it&#8217;s most fascinating, because it is so seldom written about. Virtually every person is potentially a great subject for a novel or a biography or a film. Bravo to Terkel for documenting these fascinating lives.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Is <i>Working</i> great literature? I don&#8217;t know. <i>I</i> like it, and that&#8217;s what matters to me. Others seem to like it, too.</p>
<p>In fact, I was surprised to learn that <i>Working</i> was made into a musical, with a book by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Schwartz_(composer)">Stephen Schwartz</a>, who wrote lyrics for <i>Godspell</i>, <i>Wicked</i>, and the popular 1990s Disney films (such as <i>Pocahontas</i>). Don&#8217;t believe me? Here&#8217;s soul singer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_LaBelle">Patti LaBelle</a> from 1978 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z083ojuwUhg">singing the part for the &#8220;domestic&#8221; worker</a>, Maggie Holmes:</p>
<div align="center"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/z083ojuwUhg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<p>(And here&#8217;s another song from the show: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxgMbMx3i8c">&#8220;Father and Sons&#8221;, sung by a millworker</a>. This was written by James Taylor.)</p>
<p>For years, I&#8217;ve harbored a secret dream. I want to marry two of my passions: personal finance and comic books. I would dearly love to write a graphic novel that somehow instructed readers in sound financial habits. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;ll ever happen. Until it does, I can at least be happy knowing that <i>Working</i> exists.</p>

<p><i><b>2010 Video Contest Winners</b></i><br />
As a reminder, the winner in the Success Stories category was Jessica, who had <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpJZB6xaFKg">No Regrets</a></b> for delaying her honeymoon until she and her husband could pay cash for it:</p>

<p></p>
<p>In the Money Tips category, Rachel&#8217;s <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM5uya7M1KI">Coupon Rap</a></b> took the top prize:</p>

<p></p>
<p>And in the third (bonus) category for folks with websites, Jamison won for two videos: his success story (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jJC0VWF3ao"><b>How I Paid Off My Mortgage in 10 Years</b></a>) and his money tip (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOqY-2DS0IU"><b>How to Make Your Own Laundry Detergent</b></a>). Unfortunately, Jamison has since removed his videos, which makes me sad. They were great!</p>
<p><i><b>2011 Get Rich Slowly Video Contest</b></i><br />
Well, this year, we&#8217;re going to do it again. Now that people are familiar with the format, I think more folks will be willing to enter. I hope so, because I think this contest is a lot of fun. Besides, it&#8217;s a way for you to win $500, right?</p>

For now, though, I just wanted to whet your appetites. I want you to start thinking about what tip or story you can share. (Share both, if you want!)</p>

<p>Sometimes I think that Netflix was the best thing to ever happen to me (er, besides my wonderful husband, of course). You see, when I was a Blockbuster customer, I was notoriously bad about racking up late fees. I would flat-out forget I even <em>had</em> a movie to return. There&#8217;s no telling how much money I wasted in late fees.</p>
<p>So when Netflix came on the scene, I was elated. Sure, it was another monthly bill, but I didn&#8217;t have to leave the house to rent movies — or return them. And these days I can watch every single episode of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> through the &#8220;watch instantly&#8221; queue, along with all of the foreign and indie films my heart desires. I&#8217;m not big on regular TV and don&#8217;t have cable, so the service allows us to watch the stuff we like, commercial-free.</p>
<p>But now there are even <em>more</em> options out there. Redbox, different offerings from Blockbuster, and iTunes all offer slightly different ways of renting the newest release and snuggling up on the couch with some reasonably priced popcorn. Happy with Netflix, I haven&#8217;t really looked into the others, but I thought it was about time that I did.</p>
<p><em><strong>Redbox</strong></em><br />
<a title="Redbox" href="http://www.redbox.com"><img title="Redbox" src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/redboxlogo.gif" alt="Redbox" vspace="3" width="142" height="106" align="right" /></a><a title="Redbox" href="http://www.redbox.com">Redbox</a> offers almost 25,000 kiosks for customers to rent and pickup movies. You can order and pay for your movie online and pick it up at a specified location, or you can show up to the Redbox and rent a movie directly at the kiosk, though your options will be limited. Swipe your credit card, and you&#8217;re done. To return the movie, bring it to any Redbox kiosk by 9 p.m. the day after you rent it. If you keep it longer, you&#8217;ll be charged the nightly fee plus applicable tax. After 25 days you&#8217;ll be charged for the price of the DVD, and it&#8217;s yours to keep.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $1–$1.50 per nightly rental</p>
<p><strong>Is it right for you?</strong> Redbox is cheap and there are probably kiosks near you. I see the kiosks at supermarkets and drugstores even in small towns. Also, you&#8217;re not on the hook for a monthly bill, so if there are months when you&#8217;re so busy that you don&#8217;t have time to rent a movie, you&#8217;re not out any cash for an unused subscription. The downsides are that you don&#8217;t have the option to watch movies instantly online, and if you&#8217;re bad about remembering to return movies, it won&#8217;t be so cheap anymore.</p>
<p><em><strong>iTunes</strong></em><br />
<a title="iTunes Store" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/whats-on/"><img title="iTunes Store" src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/apple.jpg" alt="iTunes Store" vspace="3" width="150" height="175" align="right" /></a>You can rent movies from the <a title="iTunes Store" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/whats-on/">iTunes Store</a> to watch on your Mac or Windows computer, iPhone, iPad, or iPod, as well as on a TV with Apple TV. When you select a movie to rent, it will begin to download and you&#8217;ll have 30 days to watch it. Once you start watching it, you&#8217;ll have 24 hours (in the US) before it will disappear from your library. If you don&#8217;t start watching it within 30 days, it will disappear from your library and you&#8217;ll have to rent it again to view it.</p>
<p><strong>Cost: </strong>$0.99–$4.99 per rental</p>
<p><strong>Is it right for you?</strong> Like Redbox, a major advantage is that you don&#8217;t have to be a member and sign on for a monthly subscription fee. iTunes is pricier, but if playing rentals on your mobile devices without a wi-fi requirement is a selling point, it might be worthwhile. I could see myself renting a movie from the iTunes Store to watch on an iPod or iPhone during a long trip.</p>
<p><em><strong>Netflix</strong></em><br />
<a title="Netflix" href="http://www.netflix.com"><img title="Netflix" src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/netflix-logo.png" alt="Netflix" vspace="3" width="200" height="93" align="right" /></a>Ahhh, <a title="Netflix" href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>. Most people are familiar with how it works. For a monthly fee, you get unlimited rentals sent to your mailbox. Keep them as long as you like, and then mail them back. There&#8217;s also a wide selection of &#8220;watch instantly&#8221; shows that you can stream to your computer, iPad, iPhone, or internet-ready TV. There are no contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Cost: </strong>For online-only viewing (no mailed DVDs), the membership is $7.99 per month. One mailed DVD at a time plus unlimited instant watching is $9.99. Two DVDs plus instant watching is $14.99, and plan pricing increases from there.</p>
<p>Is it right for you? Netflix is great if you use it enough to make the monthly fee a good deal. I view the watch instantly shows and movies quite a bit, so it&#8217;s worthwhile. Plus, we live out in the country — we usually don&#8217;t want to leave the house just to rent a movie. Downsides? Sometimes new releases have a very long wait, and if you&#8217;re busy or go out of town, you probably aren&#8217;t going to be renting as many movies. <em><strong>(Edit: Readers have pointed out in the comments that you can put your account on hold when you&#8217;re on vacation or too busy to view movies. I think I just fell in love with Netflix all over again.)</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Blockbuster</strong></em><br />
<a title="Blockbuster" href="http://www.blockbuster.com"><img title="Blockbuster" src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/blockbuster-logo.jpg" alt="Blockbuster" vspace="3" width="240" height="147" align="right" /></a><a title="Blockbuster" href="http://www.blockbuster.com/">Blockbuster</a> seems a bit like a dinosaur in the world of movie rentals, but the giant actually has the most options for customers. You can rent movies in the store, have them mailed to you, and return them at the store or through the mail, regardless of which method you used to rent them, minus due dates and late fees. You also can rent games and Blu-ray movies for no extra fees, and certain new releases are guaranteed to be in stock.</p>
<p>Blockbuster also offers On Demand rentals that you can stream to your TV, Blu-ray player, TiVo DVR, or mobile device. Similar to iTunes rentals, On Demand rentals come with a 24-hour viewing period and up to a 30-day storage period.</p>
<p><strong>Cost: </strong>For $11.99 you get one disc at a time, plus unlimited movie, TV, and game rentals and five in-store exchanges. Two discs is $16.99, and three is $19.99. On Demand is a separate service that offers rentals and purchases starting at $1.99. Payment is on a per transaction basis.</p>
<p><strong>Is it right for you?</strong> Blockbuster seems to offer everything that the first three services offer, all in one membership (plus extra for online viewing). Still, if you use online viewing a lot, you might be better off with Netflix.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, this wouldn&#8217;t be a responsible GRS post without pointing out the cheapest solution of all: your <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/05/26/frugality-in-practice-using-the-public-library/">public library</a>.</strong> Titles might not be new releases, but you can&#8217;t beat the price. For us, however, Netflix still seems to be the best option.</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you rent movies? Are there any other pros and cons to consider for the various rental options?</strong></em></p>

That&#8217;s not usually high praise for a book, but in this case I mean it to be. It took me a long time to read because it was so darn <i>useful</i>. I had to keep stopping to go do the exercises the authors suggested. Now my files are organized, my retirement funds are set up, and my favorite bookmark is free to be slotted into the next finance book I read.</p>
<p>Writers Joesph D&#8217;Agnese and Denise Kiernan have been freelancing a long time. Along the way, they&#8217;ve made all sorts of mistakes with their finances, but they&#8217;ve also gotten to a place where they have a stable, smooth financial system that works. As journalists, their work has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Wired</i>, and a dozen other places. Now they&#8217;ve turned their considerable writing talents to sharing their financial expertise. It&#8217;s a winning combination.</p>
<p><i><b>Freelancers are People Too</b></i><br />
The basic principles of money management are the same, no matter which book or expert presents them. What changes is how the information is presented, and how likely you are to be motivated to follow the advice. <i>The Money Book for Freelancers</i> is special because it frames simple money management wisdom in a way that makes sense for freelancers and contractors.</p>
<p>Independent workers have special financial needs. It was a huge help to me to see them laid out in black-and-white. I knew abstractly that I should be saving for retirement, for example. Now I know the details of an SEP-IRA, how it differs from a <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/06/07/how-to-start-a-roth-ira-and-where-to-do-it/">Roth IRA</a>, and why a self-employed person can benefit from having both accounts. I now have a <i>percentage</i> of my income set aside for retirement each month instead of a flat dollar amount.</p>
<p>The beauty of <i>The Money Book for Freelancers</i> is the organizational system it brings to sound money principles. The authors advocate a system of dedicated bank accounts very like the one I&#8217;ve been using for the past year. (J.D. uses a system similar to this, too.)</p>

<li>You want one account at a local bank that you use for your deposits, spending, and daily cash flow.</li>
<p></p>
<li>You have savings accounts dedicated to particular goals that you keep in a <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/03/21/which-online-high-yield-savings-account-is-best/">high-interest savings account</a> at an <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/01/21/best-online-bank-for-service-and-security/">online bank</a>.</li>
<p></p>
<li>The core of their system is a Holy Trinity of Savings Accounts that includes an <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/08/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund/">Emergency Fund</a>, a Tax Account and a Retirement Account.</li>
</ul>
<p>For most people at a traditional job, the employer handles the bookkeeping related to taxes and retirement. You may want to add additional retirement funds like a Roth IRA to your retirement portfolio, but at its most basic, retirement accounts and taxes are handled by your company. Doing it yourself isn&#8217;t that complicated, but it <i>can</i> seem intimidating. If you&#8217;re starting out like I am, it&#8217;s nice to have someone hold your hand through getting set up.</p>
<p>The other great thing about <i>The Money Book for Freelancers</i> is the writing style. D&#8217;Agnese and Kiernan are like personal trainers for your financial life. They&#8217;re constantly cheering you on to stretch your abilities and resources, while candidly holding you accountable for your choices. Whether you freelance or not, their attitude is refreshing. If you do freelance, you&#8217;ll likely find their life lessons and anecdotes eerily familiar.</p>
<p><i><b>Keep It Simple</b></i><br />
The weakness of this book is its authors&#8217; love of complexity. They often recommend multiple accounts in places where one would do. For example, harkening back to the example above, they recommend two or three retirement accounts for each self-employed worker: an SEP-IRA that functions a lot like a 401K, a Roth IRA, and a taxable brokerage account. For most of us, that&#8217;s overkill.</p>
<p>I make a decent salary freelancing these days. Even so, if I succeed at saving 10 percent of my income for retirement this year, I won&#8217;t save more than the $5,000 I can put into a Roth IRA. There&#8217;s no reason for me to maintain other accounts unless my income and savings jumps to a point where I&#8217;ve capped out my contributions to the Roth. I really don&#8217;t need an SEP-IRA, and won&#8217;t until my income is double my current one. While a lot of freelancers make enough money to worry about SEP-IRAs, most people are probably served just fine by a Roth IRA, and maybe a traditional IRA to pick up additional retirement savings in a good year.</p>
<p>Likewise, the authors&#8217; focus on saving for retirement before paying off debt probably means paying more interest over the long term. Yes, it&#8217;s good to establish good habits. Freelancers especially need to rely on their own savings practices. No company pension will save you if you screw it up. But saving up a big emergency fund and a retirement nest egg while you&#8217;re recovering from credit card debt can be penny wise and pound foolish. A lot of pounds of foolishness, depending on how much debt you have and what interest rates you&#8217;re paying. I&#8217;ve recently shifted some of my own <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/28/in-praise-of-the-debt-snowball/">debt snowball</a> to savings, but my remaining loans are all very low interest (under 5%), and I&#8217;m willing to pay a little more interest in exchange for building up a secure emergency fund.</p>
<p><i><b>The Bottom Line</b></i><br />
I&#8217;d like to see this book take a somewhat more streamlined approach to financial savvy. If you&#8217;re self-employed, especially if you&#8217;re just starting out, there&#8217;s plenty of good in here. It was well worth the read, and I got a lot out of the exercises. I&#8217;d just recommend it alongside another basic money book like J.D.&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596809409/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><i>Your Money: The Missing Manual</i></a> or Dave Ramsey&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159555078X/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><i>The Total Money Makeover</i></a>.</p>
<p>Probably the ideal system for any individual will be a hybrid of what various experts offer. D&#8217;Agnese and Kiernan have some wonderful ingredients in their soup, but don&#8217;t follow the recipe blindly.</p>

<p>Growing up, my parents taught me very little about financial responsibility. It wasn&#8217;t until college, when my parents expected me to pay my own car insurance, that I was forced to learn the basics of budgeting. It was just one bill, but it was traumatic to me since I&#8217;d never paid for anything myself until that point. Looking back, the lesson was introduced too late. It didn&#8217;t &#8220;take&#8221;.</p>
<p>Had I understood budgeting earlier in life, some of my financial choices might have been different. Obviously, this isn&#8217;t the <i>only</i> reason I accumulated a mountain of debt, but it&#8217;s an example of the lack of financial education I received as a kid. (Fortunately, now <a href="http://savingslifestyle.com/2010/02/debt-gone/">thousands of dollars in debt are gone</a> after a lot of planning and sacrifice &mdash; and of course, <a title="Extreme Couponing" href="http://savingslifestyle.com/strategies-to-save-earn/beginners-guide-to-saving/">using coupons</a>.) My husband and I want to teach our boys smart financial habits at a much younger age than we learned them.</p>
<p><i><b>An 11-Year-Old&#8217;s View of Money</b></i><br />
For Christmas, our 11-year old son, T, wanted wanted a cell phone. Actually, when the new iPhone 4G hit the market, he suggested that <em>he</em> could take my 3G to use so I could get the new 4G. (His generosity knows no bounds!) While his suggestion gave his parents quite a laugh, we seized the opportunity to teach him a financial lesson. Here&#8217;s a bit of that conversation:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<b>Me</b>: &#8220;T, even if you did get an iPhone, the monthly plan is expensive. Who would pay for that?&#8221;<br />
<b>T:</b> &#8220;You can just add me onto your plan, Mom.&#8221;<br />
<b>Me:</b> &#8220;You didn&#8217;t answer my question, who would pay for that?&#8221;<br />
<b>T:</b> &#8220;Well, you would. It&#8217;s only a few extra dollars a month. You and Dad work, so that&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The last statement set me off a bit! <b>My husband and I do <i>not</i> want our kids to think that just because money is earned means it has to be spent.</b> We also don&#8217;t want them to think that just because their friends have the newest <i>{fill in the blank}</i> that they need it too. After this conversation with my son, we decided to teach him a financial lesson.</p>
<p><i><b>An 11-Year-Old&#8217;s First Budget</b></i><br />
As Christmas rolled around, T kept mentioning the cell phone. He really wanted it. So, we sat down and had a more detailed discussion about budgeting.</p>
<p>Since the cell phone would be T&#8217;s first and and only bill, we talked about his <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/02/05/the-power-of-positive-cash-flow/">cash flow</a>. He makes $44 a month for <a href="http://savingslifestyle.com/2011/01/creating-chore-cards-kids/">doing his chores</a> (with potential to <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/11/10/make-more-money-how-to-supercharge-your-income/">make more money</a> each month for doing other things). We broke down his current expenses. I know he&#8217;s only 11 years old, but we really wanted this lesson to impress the importance of budgeting and giving.</p>
<p>I suggested that if he could find a phone plan that cost 50% or less of his monthly income, we&#8217;d consider the phone. The only limit to his search was that we needed a monthly payment plan without a contract. If he didn&#8217;t pay, we didn&#8217;t want to be bound to a contract we were paying for and not using. No payment means he simply wouldn&#8217;t have a phone to use (after all, <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/05/05/prepaid-cell-phones-can-save-you-money/">a cell phone is a want and not a necessity</a>).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/11yo-budget.jpg" width="250" height="250" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" alt="An 11-year-old's budget" title="An 11-year-old's budget" />Being eleven years old and not knowing how to find the information, I came up with a list of websites for him to review (with my guidance for some online safety measures). He browsed the sites, wrote down options, and noted which carriers offered a monthly service plan option.</p>
<p>After his review, he gave me his analysis and recommendation. I wasn&#8217;t surprised at the suggestion since I&#8217;d done some preliminary research myself. The lowest monthly payment plan was $25, and it did offer the monthly payment option that we required. Even though this was $3 over his $22 budget, we decided it was the best financial option meeting the requirements.</p>
<p>As we were going over the numbers again with the $25 cost, we discussed all of T&#8217;s expenses that his $44 monthly income was expected to cover. During this talk, we reminded him about <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/12/13/give-your-wealth-away-an-argument-for-a-secular-tithe/">tithing</a>, and ensuring that 10% of his income is set aside for our church.</p>
<p>T&#8217;s response to this didn&#8217;t surprise me: &#8220;That&#8217;s easy. I make $44 and will spend $25 on my phone bill. That leaves me with $19. So 10% of $19 is $2.&#8221; While I appreciated his stellar math skills, we also took the time to remind him that the 10% giving was <i>before</i> he paid any bills. For us, that lesson was equally important in his understanding of financial generosity.</p>
<p><i><b>Family Financial Responsibility</b></i><br />
Going through this budgeting process was eye-opening for all of us. While some parents are worried about having &#8220;the talk,&#8221; I was equally concerned with having this budgeting talk. This was a great lesson to teach T, but we hope that <a href="http://savingslifestyle.com/2010/09/impressions-jacked-car/">dad&#8217;s jacked up car</a> and his <a href="http://savingslifestyle.com/2010/05/reminds-andon/">first-hand look at poverty</a> also show him reasons why we make the choice to manage our money wise in the first place.</p>
<p>Maybe 2011 is the year you <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/01/03/how-to-take-control-of-your-finances-in-2011/">take control of your finances</a> and <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/12/03/free-at-last-saying-good-bye-to-20-years-of-debt/">say good-bye to debt</a>. For our family, 2011 is the year that we, as a family unit, focus on financial responsibility. And it started by teaching an 11-year-old how to budget for a cell phone.</p>

<p>Nobody likes to pay taxes. And I think we all get a little kick out of finding ways to save on our tax bill. We smile when we find a deduction we&#8217;d been missing. Maybe we think it&#8217;s a great deal because we&#8217;re sticking it to the man. Maybe the tax deduction tricks us into thinking we&#8217;re getting a discount on buying something that we want. Or maybe the tax deduction leads us to believe we&#8217;re making a smart decision. I know I get a little tingle inside when I find a new tax deduction. Don’t you?</p>
<p><i><b>Are All Tax Deductions Good?</b></i><br />
The problem is that saving on taxes usually amounts to spending cash, or worse, signing up for debt. That&#8217;s right, we&#8217;re all trying to get rich slowly, and it seems like saving taxes would go hand in hand with this, but when it comes down to it, many tax deductions are really a drain on our <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/02/05/the-power-of-positive-cash-flow/">cash flow</a> or <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/08/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund/">emergency fund</a>. Many tax deductions can <i>increase</i> risk and even can put us a little bit further behind the eight ball. All in the name of saving taxes.</p>
<p>Before I lose all of you, let me say:</p>
<ul>
<li>You shouldn&#8217;t pass up many tax deductions.</li>
<li>You must carefully plan in order to get tax deductions.</li>
<li>You should take advantage of almost every tax deduction you can find.</li>
</ul>
<p>But let’s try to put tax savings in their proper place. When you spend money, you should ask yourself these questions in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will this thing or expenditure <i>increase</i> my monthly cash flow?</li>
<li>Does this thing or expenditure increase or decrease my <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/09/11/net-worth-the-most-important-number-in-personal-finance/">net worth</a> in five years?</li>
<li>Is it tax deductible?</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the tax deduction question is number three on the list. It&#8217;s not <i>nearly</i> as important as the first two questions. I have so many customers that put tax deductibility at number one. I have some customers that sometimes forget to even think about the first two questions when they hear about number three.</p>
<p><i><b>Saving $10,800 in Taxes</b></i><br />
For example, I have a young friend who owns his own small service-oriented business.  He called me at the end of 2008 to talk about his $75,000 in <i>net</i> business income for the year. His marginal tax bracket on that net income was roughly 37%.  The 37% comes from self-employment tax of 15%, Federal income tax of 15%, and State income tax of 7%.  </p>
<div class="highlight"><i><b>Tip:</b></i> If you need to brush up on things, here&#8217;s an article on <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/03/11/how-marginal-tax-rates-work/"><b>how marginal tax rates work</b></a>.</div>
<p></p>
<p>I told my client that he was going to owe around $13,400 in total taxes. He asked me about buying a business truck at the end of the year that would cost him $35,000. I told him this would drop his taxes to $2,600, a $10,800 savings.</p>
<p>Things were tight for him. He didn&#8217;t have $13,400 saved, and he needed a new truck to make his supply runs easier. Tax savings would pay for 31% of the cost of his business truck. A no-brainer, right?</p>
<p><i><b>Penny Wise and Pound Foolish</b></i><br />
The problem is $75,000 of net self-employment business income isn&#8217;t an overwhelming amount. With a home, family, taxes, and health insurance to take care of &mdash; plus the need for savings to <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/07/27/how-to-budget-for-an-irregular-income/">manage the ups and downs of his business</a> &mdash; my client bit off more than he could chew on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Sure, he saved $10,800 in taxes that would have been due in couple of months. But to save those taxes, he decreased his monthly cash flow by having truck payments, more insurance, and more gas expense. And remember, when the vehicle is run into the ground in five years from some hard business driving, his <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/09/11/net-worth-the-most-important-number-in-personal-finance/">net worth</a> will be even less!</p>
<p>The smart move would have been to just pay the taxes. After the slow-down in the economy, my client was really struggling at the end of 2010, and will probably lose his business. The truck probably wan&#8217;t the <i>final</i> straw, but it certainly hindered the situation. When he saw the potential to save over $10,000 in taxes, his brain scrambled and his eyes glazed, and he didn&#8217;t think straight. To be honest, I might have done the same thing.</p>
<p>We probably all know people hurt by the downturn. In fact, you may be one of them. And I&#8217;m sure some of us bought things that we needed over the last few years for business, partly for the tax “savings”, and now we wish we had the cash back and had sent in a little tax dollars instead. Or even better, stuffed it into our <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/06/07/how-to-start-a-roth-ira-and-where-to-do-it/">retirement account</a>.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be confused when you&#8217;re spending money on business supplies, business trips, or business equipment. Remember: You&#8217;re spending money first, and saving taxes second.</p>
<p><i><b>You Should WANT to Pay More Taxes</b></i><br />
Now let’s look at a tax experience that more of us have to consider. When I look at the total income on the average tax return, I see the mortgage interest deduction and think to myself, “They don&#8217;t own their house &mdash; their house owns them.&#8221; How much of this is caused because that mortgage interest is tax deductible?</p>
<p>Owning a home is great, and the mortgage interest deduction is something I both like and helps us all save taxes &mdash; but don&#8217;t be beholden to it. <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/03/10/why-you-shouldnt-keep-a-mortgage-just-for-the-tax-deduction/"><b>You shouldn&#8217;t keep a mortgage just for the tax deduction!</b></a></p>
<p>I think of mortgage interest as the <i>devil</i>, not an <i>angel</i>. I&#8217;m working hard to get my house paid off in the next 5-7 years so I can pay more taxes.  Why pay off your house early when interest is so cheap, you ask? Think about rules one and two above.</p>
<p>Imagine your $1400 per month house payment is costing you $1400 in cold hard cash every month. Now imagine that you can increase your monthly cash flow by $1050 a month when you get a $1400 per month house payment paid off. Your cash flow won&#8217;t increase <i>$1400</i> per month because of the taxes that are being saved on the mortgage interest. But <b>$1050 more per month in your pocket will get you ahead way faster than saving $350 per month in taxes</b>.</p>
<p><i><b>Take Off the Goggles</b></i><br />
There are some true no-brainers when it comes to tax deductions. For instance, putting 10% of your income into regular retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, IRAs, or <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/06/07/how-to-start-a-roth-ira-and-where-to-do-it/">Roth IRA</a>s are a <i>requirement</i> in my book, not a tax opportunity. And tax credits and deductions for post-secondary education are just aiding an already good move. There are many more. </p>
<p>But remember that <b>putting the label of &#8220;tax deduction&#8221; on something doesn&#8217;t magically turn that something into a good idea or must-buy</b>. In fact, you have to take off your tax-deduction goggles and ask yourself if this is really getting you ahead in your financial life. Or is it saving you taxes while letting even more money slip through your hands?</p>

That time of year where people grouse about the greedy government. Some folks are so in need that they start looking for ways to cheat on their taxes. Here&#8217;s a hint: <b><i>Never</i> cheat on your taxes.</b> The risks far outweigh the rewards. How do I know? Because I used to work for the IRS, and I saw first-hand what happened to tax cheats.</p>
<p>When people learn I used to work for the IRS, they want in on the secret. What&#8217;s the silver bullet that will help you save the most when you file your taxes? We all know about tax deductions, but which ones are worth the trouble? In my opinion, you should look at all of them. It may seem like you don&#8217;t qualify for most at first, but if you look closely for <i>legal</i> &#8220;tax cheats&#8221; or loopholes in the IRS rules, you may find new ways to save.</p>
<p>As an advocate for the American Taxpayer, I in <i>no way</i> condone committing tax fraud. However, there are ways you can make those tax &#8220;cheats&#8221; &mdash; legal tax deductions &mdash; work for you without dire IRS consequences. Be creative, but work within the law. You just might save some money this year on your tax filings. Here are some common tax cheats people try (and fail at), as well as <i>legal</i> alternatives.</p>
<p><b><i>Pet Costs</i></b><br />
Your pet is <i>not</i> a dependent, no matter how much you feel Fido is part of the family. Even if your pets run up expensive medical bills, personal pet costs are not typically tax deductible.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tax Cheat:</b> <i>However</i>, if you have a service animal, you can claim the expenses of maintaining the animal as a medical deduction. Businesses can deduct qualifying pet costs, too. Here&#8217;s a clever example: The owners of a junkyard had to act fast to remove their snake and rat problem. Their solution was to set out bowls of cat food to attract feral cats. The cats made short work of the vermin, and the cat food was considered a legitimate business expense.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Attorney Fees</b></i><br />
If your legal dispute is &#8220;personal&#8221; in nature, the IRS won&#8217;t allow you to deduct your attorney fees. This includes common issues like divorces, property disputes, and even personal injury cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tax Cheat:</b> Attorney fees for your business are deductible (<a href="http://www.wwwebtax.com/deductions_miscellaneous/legal_fees.htm">subject to a 2% floor</a>). Oddly enough, you can deduct personal legal fees related to contesting, paying, or claiming a refund on your taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Charitable Service</b></i><br />
You can deduct goods and cash donated, but you can&#8217;t deduct services you&#8217;ve donated to a charity &mdash; even if you measure the value.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tax Cheat:</b> You can, however, deduct costs you paid while performing the service.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Telephone Landlines</b></i><br />
You can&#8217;t deduct the cost of your home telephone line, even you use that phone for your business.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tax Cheat:</b> You can, however, deduct the cost of a second telephone landline or a cell phone that is used exclusively for your business. In addition, you can deduct long distance and similar charges on your land line if you prove business use.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Commuting Costs</b></i><br />
You can never deduct the cost of going to and from work, no matter how far you live from the workplace. Even if your commute is expensive, the burden is a non-deductible expense.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tax Cheat:</b> Work-related travel expenses are deductible. This includes costs to visit clients and vendors, going to a business meeting away from where you work, and traveling back and forth during the workday.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Home Improvements</i></b><br />
The IRS considers home improvements personal expenses and will not allow you to claim these expenses as tax deductions.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tax Cheat:</b> However, if you&#8217;re installing a wheelchair ramp or making a similar health-related home improvement, you can claim the costs as medical expenses. Additionally, you can get a tax credit when you install qualifying energy-efficient home improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Gym and Health Club Fees</b></i><br />
Even if your doctor recommends you lose weight for your health, you cannot deduct expenses that are merely beneficial for your health, like gyms and health clubs. (The IRS says the same thing about specialty health foods.)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tax Cheat:</b> However, if your doctor specifically prescribes a gym or health club membership for a diagnosed medical condition it will qualify as a medical deduction.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Two Top Tips</b></i><br />
Here are two final tips for those who are looking to save on taxes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Itemize.</b> Many taxpayers claim the standard deduction amounts, and I can&#8217;t blame them. There&#8217;s less math, less document hunting, and no rules to read. Yet with minimal effort you can maximize your deductions and save big by itemizing deductions.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Pay a pro.</b> Working with a tax professional or using tax-filing software is almost always worth the investment. A qualified and reliable tax professional will find the best ways for you to save.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, these tax tips will help you save some cash this tax filing season. Remember, examine your taxes closely, and when in doubt, consult with a tax professional to see what you can and can&#8217;t deduct. You may be surprised by how greatly you can benefit from being a legal tax cheat.</p>
<div class="highlight"><i><b>J.D.&#8217;s note:</b></i> I just wanted to chime in on the value of taking the deductions for which you qualify. When I used to do my own taxes, I&#8217;d hunt for anything we could use. This didn&#8217;t save us big bucks, but it saved us enough to make it worth my while. Now, though, I&#8217;ve learned that paying an accountant to do my taxes is well worth the cost. <b>Stay tuned to GRS later today, when another expert tells us the truth about tax deductions.</b></div>

<p>Just after Christmas, <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/12/30/my-132683-comcast-bill/">Carl Hendley of The Motley Fool wrote about his cable bill</a> and how much lost investment income that money represented. As an economist, I was intrigued by the notion, and couldn&#8217;t help but run the numbers. (We economists are strange like that.)</p>
<p>Hendley&#8217;s calculations assume that the average person cares only about nominal, time-insensitive returns. That is, that a dollar today is worth a dollar tomorrow. But we economists know (from all of our fancy-pants research) that, generally speaking, that&#8217;s not how people make decisions. Instead, <b>when most folks make personal-finance decisions, they take into account the time value of money</b>.</p>
<p><i><b>The time value of money</b></i><br />
&#8220;The time value of money&#8221; is a complex term for a simple concept: Any given amount of money is worth <i>more</i> today than the same amount in the future. Assuming a 5% interest rate, for example, $100 today is worth $105 a year from now. (Or, working backward with the same assumed interest rate, $100 in a year is worth $95.24 today. And what, they&#8217;re not the same? Nope!)</p>
<p>The time value of money has two main components: inflation and personal valuation. While Hendley&#8217;s main point is correct &mdash; recurring monthly charges can be costly in the long haul, and can dramatically affect your retirement savings &mdash; the real long-term cost of his cable bill isn&#8217;t actually $132,683.</p>
<p>Citing research from <a href="http://www.gooddebt.com/"><i>Good Debt, Bad Debt</i></a> and other sources, Hendley assumes a 10% annual rate of return on $100 monthly investments made for 25 years. His example assumes that we value $100 invested today the same as we value $100 invested 25 years from now. In reality, <b>$100 today is likely to be worth much more than $100 in the future.</b></p>
<div class="highlight"><i><b>Note:</b></i> One reason stocks need to show strong long-term growth (and why bonds pay interest) is that investors must be compensated for the time value of money. Otherwise, investors could use that cash for something else.</div>
<p></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a simple rule to describe the conditions that make investors willing to invest in equities (like stocks) versus, say, <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tips_glance.htm">TIPS</a> (bonds that automatically adjust for inflation):</p>
<div class="highlight">Expected Rate of Return >= Expected Inflation Rate + Time Value of Money</div>
<p></p>
<p>In other words, <b>for an investment to make sense, its expected rate of return has to be greater than the total of</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The inflation rate.</b> In general, people react to the <i>real</i> (after-inflation) rate of return, not the nominal (pre-inflation) rate of return.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Your <i>personal</i> time value of money.</b> What could you do with your money today other than put it in this investment? This is somewhat related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>, and is very tough to measure on a personal level. We each have a different time value of money: For you, a 1% <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/03/21/which-online-high-yield-savings-account-is-best/">high-yield savings account</a> may tempt you to save, but your brother may rather spend the money on a new car instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Painful &mdash; but not as much</b></i><br />
Returning to Hendley&#8217;s cable bill, it&#8217;s fine to assume constant rates over time to keep things simple. But to show the <i>real</i> cost of paying out for cable television, you have to work some economic magic. Which I&#8217;ve done for you, using a discounting routine (or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value">net present value</a> calculation).</p>
<div class="highlight"><i><b>Note:</b></i> Though I may be violating the sacred code of <s>magicians</s> economists, you can look behind the curtain to see my calculations with <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AoH8McfeDSGYdEFiRDNBQW13MHNvM0JqQnV1ZzI1eXc&#038;hl=en&#038;authkey=CN_5qIUL">this Google spreadsheet</a>.</div>
<p></p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve done here is take the long-term cost for cable television, and compute a number that tells you what that&#8217;s worth to you <i>right now</i> if you were to invest the money instead. We need to compare apples to apples. (Or dollars to dollars, in this case.)</p>
<p>Assuming an annual inflation rate of about 3%, the net present value of $132,683 is about $63,250. That is, the $132,683 Hendley could pay toward his cable bill over the next 25 years is actually worth about $63,250 if invested in equities (such as stocks or mutual funds) returning an average of 10% with 3% inflation in today’s dollars</p>
<p>And assuming his personal time value of money &mdash; what the cash might be worth to him if used elsewhere &mdash; is also 3%, real cost of watching cable for 25 years instead of investing is about $30,000. (If you extend the time-frame to 30 years, that estimated cost grows to over $50,000. Your time-frame matters!)</p>
<p><i><b>The moral of our story</b></i><br />
When you look at savings in nominal terms &mdash; when you look at the raw numbers &mdash; you over-emphasize the value of future holdings. The future is uncertain. Inflation gnaws at your money, and consuming today is more pleasurable (and more certain) than consuming later.</p>
<p>This is a mistake that many people make when talking about personal finance. David Bach&#8217;s famous &#8220;latte factor&#8221; (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0767923820/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><i>The Automatic Millionaire</i></a> and other books) is perhaps the most notable example of this fallacy. Bach ignored the time value of money.</p>
<p>Still, his primary point &mdash; that cutting recurring costs can help you meet your savings goals &mdash; is completely valid. <b>Small, easy changes to your habits can have an <i>enormous</i> impact on your future financial status.</b> But it&#8217;s important to consider all of the factors. One way to do that is to use <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AoH8McfeDSGYdEFiRDNBQW13MHNvM0JqQnV1ZzI1eXc&#038;hl=en&#038;authkey=CN_5qIUL">my spreadsheet</a> (or something similar) to compute the net present value of the proposed savings.</p>
<p>When you do this, you can ask yourself questions like: &#8220;Would I rather have $30,000 today or cable television for the next 25 years?&#8221; There&#8217;s no one right answer. It all depends on your time value of money.</p>

(<a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/01/31/conscious-spending-in-action/"><b>Conscious spending</b></a> is one of the keys to overcoming emotional spending.)</p>
<p>Having said that, however, I know that if I relax for even a moment, I&#8217;ll be right back in my old habits. <img src="http://getrichslowly.org/images/iStock_shoppingsale.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="" title="It can be easy to give into temptation. Here are some ways to fight it." align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" style="border:0px;" />I&#8217;ll find myself at the grocery store, buying magazines to soothe a bruised ego, or shopping for music in the iTunes store because I had a stressful day at work. </p>
<p>How do I know I&#8217;ll relapse if I&#8217;m not careful? Because I do from time-to-time. When I returned from our trip to Europe last fall, for example, I spent a weekend buying clothes and gadgets that I didn&#8217;t really need. I felt anxious about returning to writing (it&#8217;s always tough to find my groove after time away), so I found myself browsing on Amazon and at <a href="http://www.rei.com/">REI</a>. Emotional spending is comforting &mdash; not just for me, but for a lot of other people besides.</p>
<p>Though I&#8217;m a <i>recovering</i> spendaholic, I&#8217;m still a spendaholic. I&#8217;m always one step away from compulsive spending.</p>
<p><i><b>Confused relationships with money</b></i><br />
People who have never suffered from compulsive spending can&#8217;t understand the problem, and you may have a hard time explaining it to them. They don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to see something and feel the urge to buy it <i>now</i>. They don&#8217;t know the lure of the shopping &#8220;rush&#8221; &mdash; and the subsequent nausea from the guilt have having spent too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overspenders&#8230;have confused and confusing relationships with money,&#8221; write psychologists Brad and Ted Klontz in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/038553101X/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><i>Mind Over Money</i></a>. &#8220;On one hand, they&#8217;re convinced that money and the things it can buy will make them happy; yet they&#8217;re often broke because they can&#8217;t control their spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, I&#8217;ve learned some ways to cope with emotional spending. Though I&#8217;m still tempted, I don&#8217;t spend nearly as much as I used to because I&#8217;ve developed habits that help me do the right thing, even when the right thing is difficult.</p>
<p><i><b>Curbing compulsive spending</b></i><br />
Here are some steps I&#8217;ve learned can help people overcome emotional spending:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cut up your credit cards.</b> If you have a problem with compulsive spending, destroy your credit cards <i>now</i>. Don&#8217;t make excuses. Don&#8217;t jot the account numbers someplace &#8220;just in case&#8221;. Don&#8217;t rationalize that you need them to help your credit score. If credit cards fuel your emotional spending, you&#8217;re better off without them.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Carry only cash.</b> Don&#8217;t use your checkbook or a debit card. Inconvenient? Absolutely, but that&#8217;s the point. If you&#8217;re a compulsive spender, your goal is to break the habit. To do this, you&#8217;ve got to make sacrifices. Spending cash is a way to remind yourself that you&#8217;re spending real money. Plastic (and to some degree checks) make this connection fuzzy.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Track your spending.</b> You may not even be aware of how much you&#8217;re spending. When I let my emotions rule my financial life, I had no idea how many books I was buying, for example. But once I started tracking every dollar that came into and went out of my life, patterns became clear. When you see your spending patterns, you can act on them.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Play mind games.</b> For some people, money isn&#8217;t an emotional issue. They&#8217;re able to make logical choices and not be tempted to otherwise. They&#8217;re lucky. For most of us, however, it doesn&#8217;t work that way. If you&#8217;re in this majority, find ways to play tricks on yourself. You might train yourself to use the 30-day rule, for instance: When you see something you want, don&#8217;t buy it right away; instead, note it on your calendar for 30 days in the future. If you still want it in a month, consider buying it. I&#8217;ve found that I can keep myself from buying a lot of stuff by simply putting it on my Amazon wish list. I come back later and wonder why I was ever tempted!</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Avoid temptation.</b> Speaking of temptation, the best way to keep from spending is to avoid situations that tempt you to spend in the first place. If your weakness is music, stay out of record stores and de-activate your iTunes account. If you tend to overspend at big department stores, stay away from the mall. Avoid the places where you normall spend, <i>especially</i> if you&#8217;re under emotional stress.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Ask for help.</b> There&#8217;s no shame in asking for help if you&#8217;re having trouble with your spending. Talk to a close friend or family member, and ask for support in breaking the cycle of compulsive spending. You may even want to seek professional help. But remember: If you ask for help, don&#8217;t get angry when your counselors call you on your missteps. Listen to what they have to say.</li>
</ul>
<p>The good news is that you <i>can</i> break free from emotional spending. The bad news is that it&#8217;s going to take work, and it won&#8217;t happen overnight. You&#8217;ll make mistakes and backslide, but when you do, don&#8217;t give up, and don&#8217;t beat yourself up over it. You&#8217;re human, after all. Stay focused on your long-term goals, and resolve to do better next time.</p>

<p>Imagine the freedom to never worry about money. Some dopes think that means having so much of the green stuff that you could never spend it all. But bad money management has put many a Richie Rich in the poor house. No, I&#8217;m talking about the kind of freedom that comes from being in control of your dough. I&#8217;m talking about a <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/09/12/the-budget-toolbox-13-tools-for-building-a-better-budget/">budget</a>.</p>
<p>I know budgets aren&#8217;t romantic. And for all those people who feel they&#8217;re entitled to buy whatever they want, whenever they want it, a budget can seem like kryptonite.  But you can choose to continue to see a budget as a major pain in the butt, or you can choose to see it as a useful tool that helps you spend your money on the things that are most important to you.</p>
<p><i><b>By Any Other Name&#8230;</b></i><br />
Once upon a time to try and get away from the stigma the word “budget” carried, I took to calling them “spending plans.” But you know what? It wasn’t the <i>word</i> people hated &mdash; it was the discipline, the work, the focus required to pre-determine how much you were going to spend, and then spend no more.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you call it a spending plan or a budget, the point of the exercise is to decide how you&#8217;ll spend your money. <b>Having a plan gives you the freedom to enjoy yourself</b> because you don&#8217;t have to worry about how you&#8217;ll pay the bill when it comes in. You&#8217;ll know, right from the start, whether you can afford the purchase you’re contemplating or not. And if you really, <i>really</i> want it, you can decide what you’re prepared to give up to get it, whatever it may be.</p>
<div class="highlight"><i><b>Note:</b></i> This sort of decision-making is what <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/01/31/conscious-spending-in-action/">conscious spending</a> is all about. Your regular expenses are mapped by a budget. When something unusual comes up, you can make the decision: Do I pull money from the grocery or gas or garden budget? Or do I wait to save for the new thing?</div>
<p>Have you ever made a large cash withdrawal from a banking machine only to wonder a few days later where all the money went? Think for a moment: Where did the last $100 you spent go? Stop for a minute and write it down. Chances are you can account for most of it, but there may be five, ten, or twenty dollars missing from your list.</p>
<p><i><b>Why You Should Track Your Spending</b></i><br />
What does it cost you to live each month? Some people under-estimate their expenses because they forget the things that don&#8217;t occur every month.</p>

<li>Did you include your gym costs even though you pay them once a year?</li>
<li>How about your house or <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/09/14/insurance-basics-how-car-insurance-works/">car insurance</a>?</li>
<li>Did you include the cost of your haircuts, your contact lenses, or your vacation?</li>
<li>Do you pay someone to shovel your snow, clean your windows and carpets or do your taxes?</li>
<li>What about your <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/03/07/the-high-cost-of-cats-and-dogs-are-pets-worth-the-money/">vet bills</a>, the flowers for your garden or patio, your best-friend’s birthday present?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people under-estimate their expenses because they actually don’t know how much they’re spending on things like take-out, clothes, and coffee. Over and over <b>when I show folks how much money they’re spending on the non-essentials of life, they&#8217;re gob-smacked</b>. Well, the only way to make a budget that will work is to know what you have been spending so you get some sense of what you’re going to have to change. </p>
<p><b>One of the best ways to gain a perspective on your spending habits is to <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/22/track-every-penny-you-spend/">keep a log of everything you spend</a></b>, each time you do a transaction. The idea is to figure out where you&#8217;re spending all those dimes that seem to go missing each month. It&#8217;s also about learning more about yourself and where your place your priorities. This isn&#8217;t about shame, blame, or deprivation. You don&#8217;t have to change anything you don&#8217;t want to change. But you should at least <i>know</i>. <b>With a spending log, you&#8217;ll have a clear picture of what you&#8217;re getting for your money.</b></p>
<p>When you do all your money management in your head, it&#8217;s very easy to forget things &mdash; sometimes important things &mdash; that will have an impact on your overall financial life. You&#8217;re always guessing how much you have left. And you shouldn&#8217;t really be surprised when your account is overdrawn. After all, if you don&#8217;t know how much you have, how can you know how much you can spend?</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t believe you can find the time to maintain your budget &mdash; collecting receipts, entering details onto your budget, adding it all up and balancing it out &mdash; think about the time you have to spend solving the problems that arise from not taking care of the details. And think about all the money you waste on <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/06/24/how-to-avoid-overdraft-fees/">overdraft fees</a>, interest costs, and ATM transactions. You&#8217;ll have to decide whether you&#8217;d rather live life peacefully, or continue waking to the specter of financial worry rattling his chains at the foot of your bed.</p>

<p>Long-distance relationships can be exciting, challenging, fulfilling, and all sorts of other adjectives&#8230;but &#8220;frugal&#8221; rarely makes the list. And for good reason &mdash; the transportation costs alone in maintaining a relationship with someone in a different city, state, or country can pack a powerful punch to your pocketbook. So how do you embrace frugality as a value without devaluing your relationship? </p>
<p>In the past, J.D. has shared his <a href ="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/12/22/the-basic-law-of-frugality/ ">basic law of frugality</a>: <b>&#8220;Decide what&#8217;s important to you. Give yourself permission to spend on these things. Pinch pennies on everything else.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Most people in long-distance relationships have already determined that maintaining the relationship is important to them, whether they&#8217;re a long-term couple recently separated by work, school, or the military, or even a relatively new couple who want to see where things go. So once you&#8217;ve determined that the relationship is one of those &#8220;important things&#8221; in your life, the next logical step is to lower costs on those things that are less important by cutting back on entertainment that you get little value from, or on non-essential services.</p>
<p>But even after all that, how do you romance your two-flights-away sweetheart without blowing your budget? </p>
<p><em><strong>Transportation</strong></em><br />
At the beginning of my relationship, we were flying 2000 miles each way to visit each other, and I&#8217;d just book whatever flight I could find for a specific travel date. Then in the summer of 2008, I watched as fuel prices rose, and airlines hiked fares and tacked on fees. Costs fluctuated, and the unpredictability of my transportation costs took its toll on my budget &mdash; a plane ticket might set me back $300 one month and $460 the next! It was imperative that I educate myself.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in the same position, I encourage you to look through some of the <a href ="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/12/01/5-little-known-websites-that-will-save-you-time-and-money-when-booking-airfare-online/ ">flight-booking tips</a> that have already appeared on GRS to maximize your savings. And if you&#8217;re flying a lot for your relationship, be sure to sign up for frequent-flyer programs. Those 2000-mile legs added up quickly, and it was a nice bonus to get a free flight here and there and give my budget a little more breathing room.</p>
<p>In addition to hunting around for the best prices, though, <b>plan your visits as far in advance as you can</b>. That way, you can stretch your vacation days by adding them onto days you already have off of work, perhaps substituting one long visit for two shorter ones. It also helps to space out your visits evenly, so you don’t end up booking an expensive trip last-minute because you haven’t seen your girlfriend for three months and you miss her terribly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Entertainment</strong></em><br />
When you <em>are</em> together, resist the urge to fill all your time with movies and concerts and restaurants; instead, choose activities that are less expensive, but still allow you to interact with each other.</p>
<p>Play <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/04/16/finding-frugal-fun-with-board-games/">board games</a> in the park, visit obscure local museums, or just snuggle close on the couch and catch each other up on your lives. When your partner comes for a visit, remember that he isn&#8217;t as familiar with your city as you are. If it&#8217;s your hometown, show your sweetie around your old high school and childhood home. Or play tourists for a day and visit all the must-see attractions in your town. (Head for Central Park or the Statue of Liberty if you live in New York, tour the monuments in D.C., visit the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and so forth.)</p>
<p>Take lots of pictures and embrace the cheesiness of it all!</p>
<p><em><strong>Gifts</strong></em><br />
It can be tempting to go overboard with gifts in a long-distance relationship &mdash; as if an expensive, flashy gift could make up for all those miles between you. But <b>the gifts that will mean the most to your long-distance sweetheart are the gifts that are unique and meaningful to the two of you</b>.</p>
<p>Get prints made of photos you&#8217;ve exchanged on your cell phones. Go to a used-book store and find the books you loved as a kid &mdash; <em>Charlotte&#8217;s Web</em>, <em>James and the Giant Peach</em> &mdash; that you can read to each other over the phone. Use your talents to make something that&#8217;s really from the heart, such as sending homemade treats if you&#8217;re a whiz in the kitchen, or writing a letter describing the moment you fell in love if you have a way with words. Remember, the gifts that are really <i>you</i>, even if they hardly cost a thing, are the gifts that will bring you closer together when you&#8217;re far apart. </p>
<p>As much as geography presents challenges, monetary and otherwise, for two people in a long-distance relationship, a big part of what can make such a relationship successful is being mindful about both how you spend your money, and how you spend your limited time together. A little creative planning lets you worry less about your money, and focus on your honey.</p>
<p><strong><em>Have you ever been in a long-distance relationship? What are some of the creative ways you and your partner managed your transportation, entertainment, and gift budgets?</em></strong></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve spent two days in Johannesburg, South Africa; two days in Kasane, Botswana; and a morning in a Namibian village. We have three days scheduled in Victoria Falls, and then we&#8217;ll move back to South Africa for the rest of our trip. So far, the people, the scenery, and the wildlife have been amazing. </p>

<p></p>
<p>A few bits of housekeeping:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have limited internet access while I&#8217;m in southern Africa. (Plus, I&#8217;m not really trying.) That means it&#8217;s tough for me to reply to comments and e-mail. I apologize.</li>
<p></p>
<li>While I&#8217;m away, there are two posts each Monday through Thursday, with one post each day from Friday through Sunday. As usual when I&#8217;m on vacation, there are more guest posts than normal. If you don&#8217;t like a particular guest post (and there are a couple that people may not like), please be patient. Within a few hours, you&#8217;ll have something new to read.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Finally, I want to note that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/10/pf/jd_roth/index.htm">I did a guest post for CNN Money</a> last week (you&#8217;ll probably recognize the story), and the comments were&#8230;well, less civil than the conversation at Get Rich Slowly. Thanks for the continued higher level of discourse here. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203771904574173874199242710.html">Others appreciate it</a>, and so do I.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming this week at GRS: Two posts about tax deductions, an 11-year-old&#8217;s first budget, a post from me about compulsive spending, and my review of a graphic novel about personal finance! I should have an internet connection for the next couple of days, so I may join a conversation or two. Or I may be exploring Zimbabwe. Which do <i>you</i> think I&#8217;ll choose?</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdroth/5442260711/" title="Namibian Skies by jdroth, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/5442260711_66864a46a6_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Namibian Skies" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdroth/5442867956/" title="Summer Squall on the Chobe River by jdroth, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5055/5442867956_55dd1835bd_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Summer Squall on the Chobe River" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdroth/5442861124/" title="African Sunset by jdroth, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4109/5442861124_8dc995ec05_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="African Sunset" /></a><br /><i>Africa&#8217;s ever-changing sky &mdash; just a few hours apart in Namibia</i></div>
<p></p>
<p>The real question is: Will Kris and I celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day by bungee jumping from the bridge over the Zambezi River? (The bridge separates Zimbabwe from Zambia.) Or is ziplining across the canyon more romantic?</p>

<p>In just a few short months, I will be &mdash; <i>gasp!</i> &mdash; thirty years old. Thirty always seems so old when you’re young, but it sneaks up quickly. After reading RJ’s article on Gen-Y Wealth about <a href="http://www.genywealth.com/20-financial-milestones-reach-20s">financial milestones</a> (and <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/12/20/finding-financial-benchmarks-and-milestones/">J.D.’s follow-up article</a>,) I wanted to take some time to reflect on my own financial milestones.  Since I haven’t reached all the milestones, like “Pay off student loans,” my focus is on my milestone mistakes and the important lessons that will undoubtedly shape my thirties.</p>
<p><i><b>My Early Twenties</b></i><br />
A little background information is needed to understand my situation at 20. I was born to teenage parents in a small, rural town; we never had much growing up, but we also never lacked anything necessary.</p>
<p>Long story short, I was the first in my family to pursue a bachelor’s degree, and I had my heart set on attending a private university in St. Louis that came with a hefty price tag. To get through, I relied on my credit cards and student loans. I began to think of them almost like my own money instead of viewing them for what they really were. I always paid on time and played the 0% APR credit card game for most of my twenties.</p>
<p>At age 20, I studied abroad in Madrid, Spain for one semester. I found myself saying the phrase “It’s only money” on multiple occasions as I justified splurges on souvenirs that just collect dust to this day. (Did I really need shot glasses and t-shirts from Hard Rock Café?)</p>
<p>I graduated with honors, and the next day was on a plane to South Africa for a graduate study abroad program. The poverty in Cape Town is beyond overwhelming. On a visit to the townships, I saw a little boy playing with a wooden block, pretending it was a car. I’ll never forget that image, and I wish I could have incorporated his creativity into my own life.</p>
<p>At this time, I was buying books, electronic gadgets, dinners out, vacations, and other non-essentials on credit cards. My graduate program was completely paid for with an assistantship, but I still took out $8500 in student loans just because I could.</p>
<p><i><b>My Mid- to Late-Twenties</b></i><br />
In one month &mdash; March 2006 &mdash; I got engaged, bought a house, successfully defended my master’s thesis, and accepted a tenure-track teaching job at a community college. It’s hard to plan a wedding and furnish a new home, but with the bigger paychecks coming in, it’s very easy to justify every little whim.</p>
<p>The debt grew bigger, and so did our ambitions. We bought and “flipped” two homes in our neighborhood using what we jokingly called “O-P-M” &mdash; other people’s money. And by people, we mean Bank of America, American Express, Discover, Chase, and all their friends. Fortunately, our hard work paid off, and we were able to start attacking the debt and building savings. I still owe for students loans, and my husband and I recently opened a bakery which required taking on some debt, but our financial picture has greatly improved and we are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><i><b>Lessons Learned</b></i><br />
What have I learned over the past decade? Just as J.D. has compiled <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/04/15/the-get-rich-slowly-philosophy/">a list of his financial tenets</a>, I have some of my own:</p>
<ul>
<li><b></b><b>Save and plan.</b> Before leaving for Spain, I cashed in a stack of $50 EE savings bonds that my grandpa had given me every Christmas. It felt good to cash those in for something I really wanted, having resisted cashing them in for Stuff.  I really enjoy travel and have learned how gratifying it is to save up for a trip instead of relying on plastic.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Think before spending.</b> I love to travel, but my only souvenirs these days are pictures, postcards, and magnets. They are affordable, and I get the pleasure of looking through scrapbooks for the rest of my life. My magnets are a collage of my experiences, and I cherish each one.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Experiences trump Stuff.</b> I used credit cards to finance my life through college and my master’s program. While I don’t regret my education, I should have developed a more frugal lifestyle. I wrongly justified using credit cards to buy a lot of Stuff I didn’t need. This is a lesson I don’t want to ever forget.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Communicate.</b> My husband did not have any credit card debt or student loans when we started dating. I felt like I was dragging him down. I’ve learned how important it is to communicate financial goals and to be open about the past in order to build a future together.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Life is not without risks.</b> Big financial decisions should not be made lightly, and it’s important to make ethical decisions and listen to your gut.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Educate yourself.</b> I feel like I had to start from scratch when it came to learning about personal finance in my mid/late-twenties. My parents have made irresponsible financial decisions, but I can’t blame them for my own. I have read Get Rich Slowly and other personal finance blogs and books for a couple years now. I enjoy reader stories, guest posts, and general advice that are all genuine and personal.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Money must be respected.</b> Conscious spending, diligent saving/planning, and understanding the difference between wants and needs will make my thirties my best decade so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I reflect on my twenties, I can’t help but think about the post-it note advice my dad gave me before I left for four months in Spain at age 20. The night before I left, he asked to look at the travel book I was taking with me. When I opened the book while in Spain, I found that he&#8217;d put post-it notes on different pages that he knew I would look at while traveling. It still brings tears to my eyes to think about these notes, and my favorite one says, “Remember, Jennifer, you will always be happy if you have peace in your heart.”</p>
<p>Making peace with my financial decisions has definitely brought me happiness, and these lessons will stay with me throughout my life.</p>
<div class="highlight"><i><b>Reminder:</b></i> This is a story from one of your fellow readers. <i><b>Please be nice.</b></i> After more than a decade of blogging, <i>I</i> have a thick skin, but it can be scary to put your story out in public for the first time.

That&#8217;s the plan! After a one-year hiatus, Kris and I intend to track our spending and our profit for the food we grow on our land. January saw no spending and no harvest, though. To get us started, <b>here&#8217;s a guest post from my wife about the long-term rewards of gardening</b>.</i></p>
<p>What do growing home food crops and getting rich have in common? They’re both best done slowly!</p>
<p>When many people think of growing their own food, they picture an annual vegetable garden with lush tomatoes, tall stalks of corn, leafy greens, and other salad-bowl crops. These edibles definitely have their place in a home-farming scheme, but I think of them as more of a short-term solution. Effort in the early spring pays off throughout the spring, summer, and fall, but you have to start over each year, not gaining much long-term ground.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="http://getrichslowly.org/images/2008garden.jpg" width="480" height="240" alt="" title="Our garden in mid-summer -- pea trellis on the right" /><br /><i>Our vegetable garden in summer.</i></div>
<p></p>
<p>If you <i>really</i> want to reap the <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/04/02/the-extraordinary-power-of-compound-interest/">compound returns</a> of a home garden, you’ll need to expand your thinking to the long-term investment required for trees and other long-lived garden crops.</p>
<p>A patient gardener who plans ahead can start with small, inexpensive plants and let them grow over the long term. If you wait too long, though, you&#8217;ll have to contribute a <i>lot</i> more to make up for the delay &mdash; at least if you want a big enough harvest to do anything with. <b>A fruit tree is the perfect example of a gardening investment that can pay out far more than you put in</b> &mdash; if you&#8217;re willing to be patient for a few years while your investment matures.</p>

<p></p>
<p><i><b>A Garden of Wants</b></i><br />
When J.D. and I moved into our house seven years ago, the property contained 125 beautiful rose bushes &mdash; but not a single edible plant. Well, there are a handful of nut trees, but we never see any nuts. These are hoarded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdroth/3129107216/">the thriving squirrel population</a>. (Okay, okay, I realize roses are actually edible, but that’s a heck of a lot of rose-petal jelly and rose-hip tea!)</p>
<p>One of the first improvements we made was to even the balance between the “ornamental” garden and the portion of the yard dedicated to productive food crops. To put it into personal finance terms, our garden &mdash; heavy on roses, lawn, and flowering shrubs &mdash; was all discretionary purchases and instant gratification. <b>Our yard was filled with &#8220;wants&#8221;.</b></p>
<p>These plantings, although appreciated for their beauty, needed a lot of upkeep (pruning, mowing, dead-heading) and didn’t provide much in the way of useful goods in return. We needed to make some gardening investments that would pay off in the future by adding healthy food to our diets and removing costs from our budget.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdroth/505117718/" title="Rose (&quot;Gold Medal&quot;) by jdroth, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/202/505117718_56ffd59efd.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Rose (&quot;Gold Medal&quot;)" /></a><br /><i>Pretty, but not much of a meal.</i></div>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>Waste Not, Want Not</b></i><br />
Our first summer in the house, I labeled all the rose bushes with color information and made a garden diagram showing which roses stayed and which ones were to go. Then, we had a rose-adoption weekend and invited friends and co-workers to come dig. We exchanged some of the rose bushes for horse manure in a Craigslist trade. (We discarded a few sickly plants altogether.) Down to &#8220;only&#8221; 60 rose bushes, we had now freed room for an herb garden, a vegetable plot, and several blueberry plants. </p>
<p>Our first fall, we took advantage of prime tree-planting time to start our little orchard in the side lawn.  Two apple trees, a grafted pear, and an Italian plum later, we had the “bare root” beginnings of our fruit portfolio. These spindly young trees didn’t look like much, and we knew it would be several years before they truly began to bear fruit. But in that respect, a gardener must be like a patient investor.</p>
<p><b>By starting early in our home ownership, we could plant inexpensive small trees and allow time for natural growth.</b> Now, almost seven years later, these trees are providing sizable annual crops for us to enjoy, and we’ve added two Asian pears and a cherry tree to increase our crop diversity, and to give us harvests through a longer season.</p>
<p>Our first spring, we dug up more areas of lawn to create a trellised grapevine and a caneberry patch. We planted strawberries between the rose bushes in the flower gardens. We were able to keep costs low on these projects because the grape cuttings came from our neighbors, and the strawberry divisions were contributed by friends. (Actually, the strawberries were divided from plants that <i>we</i> had given to these same friends from our previous home&#8217;s garden. How&#8217;s that for karma?) To build trellises for our grapes and caneberries, we used lumber donated by <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/05/13/a-real-millionaire-next-door/">the real millionaire next door</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p><i><b>The Automated Garden</b></i><br />
After our initial investment of money and hard work, we could sit back and watch our garden grow. We give it some annual maintenance (weeding and pruning) and periodic contributions of fertilizer and pest-control, but the upkeep is low in comparison to the return. (And low in comparison to the upkeep required by the rose bushes themselves!) We start with strawberries in May and June, keep eating berries of one kind or another through August, enjoy pears, plums and apples in the fall, and snip away herb dividends all year long. Nothing to plant, little to purchase. <b>These parts of our home garden are almost on auto-pilot.</b></p>
<p>Some of the garden investments have paid off better than others, just as in our real-life finances.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fruit trees deliver a bonus as they blossom in the spring. They&#8217;ve been both low-maintenance and high yield.</li>
<p></p>
<li>But the asparagus patch is only now beginning to be worthwhile (after five years!). J.D. would argue that the asparagus is a liability and ought to be yanked from the garden, but I like the spindly little ferns.</li>
<p></p>
<li>The gooseberries, attacked by sawfly larvae and only barely edible, were a bad choice that we decided to uproot.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Unexpected growth of the blackberries has crowded out the less-vigorous raspberries. I guess we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised &mdash; this is Oregon, where blackberries grow like weeds.</li>
<p></p>
<li>The monster red currant shrub is threatening its blueberry neighbors.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess there&#8217;s some garden <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/04/14/investing-101-an-introduction-to-asset-allocation/">portfolio rebalancing</a> in our future.</p>
<p>J.D. and I are reaping the rewards of the gardening choices we made years ago. We dedicated space in the yard to items that had a delayed payoff, knowing that it would be worth it in the long run. Now our garden has both beauty and bounty, and we’re relishing the fruits of our labors.  </p>
<p><b>What do you have room for in <i>your</i> yard?</b> How much effort and space do you already give to ornamental plants and grass? Can you make space for a dwarf fruit tree or two? How about some herbs or fruit-bearing bushes? Grow some food! You&#8217;ll be enjoying the returns and dividends for years to come.</p>

<p>I have a question for other GRS readers. It’s a simple question: <b>Should I sell my car?</b> It actually seems to have a very simple answer: Yes.  </p>
<p>I keep writing lists and outlining the reasons why I should sell my car (and why I shouldn’t), and the balance lies very clearly in favor of selling my car. And yet I’m having the hardest time selling my car. </p>
<p>Why? I’m a practical, logical, pragmatic person. Why is this so hard to do? Why is selling my car so difficult? Even with the facts laid out, staring me in the face, I’m having the hardest time selling my car. </p>
<p><i><b>Why I Bought a Car in the First Place</b></i><br />
I used to live completely car-free. I lived in different cities and only walked, bused, or biked to get around &mdash; occasionally living the high life and taking a taxi when I felt like being luxurious. And then I moved to California.</p>
<p>I bought a car last year. I purchased a 2010 Toyota Matrix from a dealer, priced at $17,490, with a $1000 rebate for being a recent college grad. The Kelly Blue Book value of the car, at new, was $20,049.  My purchase price was $16,490. With taxes, registration, and fees, I forked over $19,009.  As a somewhat-savvy consumer, I secured a three-year financing plan with 0% interest. </p>
<p>I bought the car because I lived 40 miles from my job, commuting an hour each way (through San Francisco, across the Golden Gate Bridge), and there wasn’t sufficient public transportation to get me to and from my job. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now owned (and paid for) the car for 12 months, spending $6800 on car payments. I have $12,200 left to pay on the car over a two-year period.</p>
<p>The cost of the car has been unbelievable. In one year, these are the costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Car payments &mdash; <b>$529 per month</b></li>
<li>20,000 miles total
<ul>
<li>25 mpg average</li>
<li>gas price is $3.15 in California</li>
<li>$2520 for gas, or</li>
<li><b>$210 per month</b> in gasoline</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maintenance for one year (four tune-ups at $109 each) &mdash; $436 (<b>$36 per month</b> for maintenance)</li>
<li>Insurance &mdash; <b>$109 per month</b> for insurance (AAA)</li>
<li>Bridge Tolls (crossing the Golden Gate Bridge every day costs $5) &mdash; <b>$80 per month</b></li>
<li>Parking. I’m lucky to have free parking, mostly, unless I drive downtown &mdash; <b>$50 per month</b> is my average for parking</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Every month, I spend about $1014 on driving and owning the car.</b> $1014! This is roughly one third of my take-home income. What would I do with $1014 per month?!?</p>
<p>In addition, I have a substantial amount of debt from undergraduate and graduate student loans (in the realm of $80,000) that I’m currently working hard to pay off. The student loan payments are $679 per month. I struggle to make the car payment and the student loan payment each month. </p>
<p><i><b>Today: The Current Situation</b></i><br />
In November, I moved back to San Francisco, because I couldn’t stand the long commute. Commuting through city traffic is tiring and psychologically draining; I quickly remembered why I dislike driving so much. In contrast, San Francisco is a hub of public transportation options &mdash; sometimes better or worse, depending on the neighborhood that you live in.</p>
<p>I now live eight miles from my job in Sausalito. The drive takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on traffic. Parking at my job is easy, but parking in San Francisco is a nightmare &mdash; it can take up to 40 minutes to find a parking spot. I have the option of purchasing a parking spot, but those cost upwards of $300 in a city like San Francisco, and I can’t stomach how much I’m already spending on the car alone.</p>
<p>I now have alterative means for getting to work. For example, I can bike to work a few days per week, depending on the day and the weather. There&#8217;s also a bus line that goes to and from my work on the hour, and takes about 30-40 minutes to get to work (it doubles my commute time, but I don’t have to worry about parking, driving, or concentrating on the road).</p>
<p><i><b>The (Easy) Conclusions</b></i><br />
I worry that it’s a mistake to sell my car after owning it for one year. My parents tell me that I should wait it out for the next two years, buckle down, and just finish making the payments &mdash; because I need a car and can’t possibly live without one. People suggest that it’s foolish to buy a brand new car and sell a car within the first year of ownership. </p>
<p>However, I also think that <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/09/08/the-sunk-cost-fallacy-good-money-after-bad/">sunk costs</a> are sunk costs. What I’ve already spent on the car is gone; it&#8217;s what I spend in the <i>future</i> that&#8217;s still up for determination. I think it makes sense for me to sell my car. </p>
<p>Here are some reasons I think I should sell my car:</p>
<ul>
<li>Living in a city &mdash; with ample public transportation, alternative car-sharing options, bicycle riding, and walking &mdash; makes having a car a luxury, not a necessity.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Getting rid of $12,200 of unpaid debt is a good thing.</li>
<p></p>
<li>There are additional costs to car ownership &mdash; insurance, gas, parking, maintenance &mdash; that will continue to add up over time. (To the tune of about $450 per month.)</li>
<p></p>
<li>The current value of my car ($14,000) is more than I owe on my payments ($12,200)</li>
</ul>
<p>But wait! There&#8217;s more! </p>
<ul>
<li>A car is a depreciating asset, and will not add any value over time. Struggling to make these payments does not help me reduce or eliminate debt in other areas of my life.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Public transportation to work costs $4 each way, or approximately $160 per month.</li>
<p></p>
<li>If I also choose to use a car-sharing program on the weekends, I would spend between $50 and $75 for a weekend use &mdash; but the cost would be elective, and not fixed.</li>
<p></p>
<li>If I don’t spend the money on the car, I can spend the money on other things that are more important.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems painfully clear, on paper, that I should sell my car. And yet I get in and drive it every single day &mdash; to teach swim lesson after work, to dinner parties, to events, on trips to Tahoe, on excursions. I am afraid of selling my car. Psychologically and emotionally, I’m attached to it. I also stubbornly don’t want to admit I made a mistake in buying the car in the first place.</p>
<p><b>So tell me, fellow GRS readers, what should I do? Can I afford to sell my car? Can I afford <i>not</i> to?</b></p>
<p><i><b>J.D.&#8217;s note:</b> Though I don&#8217;t have room for my traditional long reply, I&#8217;ll just chime in to say I&#8217;m glad that Sarah mentioned sunk costs. That&#8217;s a very important thing to remember in making these sorts of decisions. (What you&#8217;ve spent already is irrelevant; it&#8217;s what you spend going forward that matters.) And I think her situation highlights why it&#8217;s often best to buy a cheap used car than a brand-new one. I think a $2,000 <a href="http://www.beaterreview.com/">beater</a> would be perfect for her.</i></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve shared this service with GRS readers in the past, and will do so every year in the future (so long as the program exists). I think it&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the 2010 tax year, you can use Traditional Free File (where you use tax software with step-by-step help) if your adjusted gross income is $58,000 or less. By using software, you don&#8217;t have to do the math, and the programs check your inputs for accuracy. (Note that not every partner company provides state tax preparation.) <b>This year, the IRS has a &#8220;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/wizard.jsp">help me find a Free File company</a>&#8221; wizard to match users to the appropriate program.</b></li>
<p></p>
<li>There&#8217;s also a version of <a href="http://www.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freefilefillableforms.org">Free File with <i>no</i> income limits</a>. This option doesn&#8217;t include any sort of fancy software or step-by-step help; instead, you fill out online versions of blank IRS forms 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ. (The forms do have basic calculation abilities.) There&#8217;s no state option with these free fillable forms.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Free File is a great deal for many people.</b> Check into it if you haven&#8217;t done your taxes yet. For more info, read the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id=118993,00.html">Free File FAQ</a> at the IRS website. (The IRS website is actually awesome. You can find tons of tax info there. I&#8217;m not ashamed to admit that I&#8217;ve spent many hours digging through their resources.)</p>
<p><b>If <i>you&#8217;ve</i> used Free File before, please share your impressions.</b> I&#8217;m sure other GRS readers would welcome hints and tips. For myself, I&#8217;ll be off to see my accountant as soon as I return from Africa. I don&#8217;t qualify for Free File &mdash; and besides, my accountant always saves me money. (He&#8217;s better at doing taxes than I am, believe it or not.)</p>

<p>Valentine&#8217;s Day is a commercialized holiday, but I say, &#8220;So what!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure, you don&#8217;t need a holiday to show appreciation for your significant other, but why miss out on the extra chance to do it? Besides, you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to celebrate the way the commercials tell you to, with boxes of cream-filled chocolate, stuffed animals, jewelry, or an overpriced <em>prix fixe</em> menu.</p>
<p><em><strong>A cold and miserable V-Day</strong></em><br />
I remember the last Valentine&#8217;s Day before my then-boyfriend (now-husband) and I decided to opt out of the traditional chocolates and dinner reservations celebration. He picked me up and we went to a great little restaurant across town. We had dinner reservations, but we still had to wait an hour-and-a-half past our reservation for a seat. Outside. In the cold. When I say it was a little restaurant, I mean there was an indoor waiting area that seated maybe four people.</p>
<p>By the time we were seated, we were cold, tired, and hungry. Normally, we love that restaurant. But on Valentine&#8217;s Day, it was a completely different experience. We decided that next year we&#8217;d go all-out on a Valentine&#8217;s Day dinner &mdash; at home. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done every year since.</p>
<p><i><b>DIY Romance</b></i><br />
Valentine&#8217;s Day, like any other day, is what you make of it. It&#8217;s only commercialized if that&#8217;s how you choose to celebrate it. It can be hard, however, to come up with creative alternatives, especially since commercials for chocolate, flowers, and such are blaring over the TV and radio waves. <strong>If unique and low-key is more your style, here are five Valentine&#8217;s Day ideas for your loved ones:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instead of dinner reservations, make a simple dinner for two.</strong> If you like the idea of cooking a meal at home, but want someone else to do the planning, magazine <em>Bon Appétit</em> is happy to oblige with its <a title="Seductively Simple Valentine's Day Menu for Two" href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/menus/2011/02/valentines_day_menu_for_two">Seductively Simple Valentine&#8217;s Day Menu for Two</a>. Recipes include Radicchio and Arugula Salad with Roasted Pepper Dressing and Burrata Crostini, Pan-Seared Strip Steak with Red-Wine Pan Sauce and Pink-Peppercorn Butter, and Lemon Shortbread Heart Cookies. (I might be using this menu myself!) Bonus points: Create a play list of love songs to provide the soundtrack for your evening.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Instead of a Hallmark card, make handmade Valentines. </strong>Handmade cards are charming, but it can be hard to get started. You probably don&#8217;t want the end result to look like something you made in elementary school. Avie Designs offers a good tutorial on <a title="Papel Picado Valentines" href="http://aviedesigns.blogspot.com/2010/01/papel-picado-valentines.html">Papel Picado Valentines</a> that uses paper-cut tissue paper to create card designs.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Instead of a heart-shaped box of chocolates, make homemade fudge with an even sweeter surprise. </strong>Sometimes I can&#8217;t stand how crafty Martha Stewart is, but I can&#8217;t help but to like her. For Valentine&#8217;s Day, make her <a title="Creamy Fudge Hearts" href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/creamy-fudge-hearts?backto=true&amp;backtourl=/photogallery/valentines-day-gifts#slide_16">Creamy Fudge Hearts</a> and package each one in a <a title="Sweet Surprises" href="http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/valentines-day-gifts#slide_52">cupcake paper with a message underneath</a>.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Instead of a dozen roses from the flower shop, turn supermarket flowers into a beautiful bouquet.</strong> Think it&#8217;s not possible to make carnations or baby&#8217;s breath into something stunning? Think again! <a title="Turn Supermarket Flowers Into Beautiful Bouquets" href="http://www.realsimple.com/holidays-entertaining/weddings/flowers/wedding-flowers-bouquets-supermarket-00000000000483/index.html"><em>Real Simple</em> offers up an easy tutorial</a> on how to use less expensive flowers to make elegant bouquets. I&#8217;ve officially changed my anti-carnation stance (announcing it on GRS makes it official).</li>
</ul>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.countryliving.com/crafts/projects/how-to-make-embroidered-portraits-step-two#fbIndex1"><img style="margin: 3px 5px;" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5015/5398779076_e90c54c108.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" vspace="3" width="256" /></a></div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instead of a stuffed teddy bear, make <a title="How to Make Embroidered Portraits" href="http://www.countryliving.com/crafts/projects/how-to-make-embroidered-portraits-step-two#fbIndex1">embroidered portraits</a></strong>, featured in the latest issue of <em>Country Living</em>. Each portrait can be hand-sewn in less than an hour. Make a copy  of a photo, affix the copy to watercolor paper, and outline  the image by using a pin to punch holes. Next, remove the photo and use  embroidery thread to sew a running stitch along the holes to create the portrait.</li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite DIY projects save money and don&#8217;t take too much time to complete, and each of these relatively simple projects fit the bill. I say instead of boycotting Valentine&#8217;s Day, reclaim it. Here&#8217;s to a heartfelt celebration of love this February 14th!</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your plans for Valentine&#8217;s Day? Do you take a DIY approach, and if so, what are some of your favorite project ideas?</strong></em></p>

Income tax is illegal!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never known how to respond to these folks. Now, I can just point them to the <a href="http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html"><b>Tax Protester FAQ</b></a>. This comprehensive collection of tax protester fallacies was put together by Pennsylvania attorney Daniel B. Evans. Evans says that there are two types of tax protesters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who refuse to pay taxes <a href="http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#religion">for religious/moral reasons</a>.</li>
<li>Those who refuse to pay taxes &#8220;out of a mistaken belief that the federal income tax is unconstitutional, invalid, voluntary, or otherwise does not apply to them under one of a number of bizarre arguments&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>His FAQ addresses the assertions made by the second set of people. </p>
<div class="highlight"><i><b>Note:</b></i> The IRS devotes a section of its own site to <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxpros/article/0,,id=159853,00.html">the truth about frivolous tax arguments</a>. This is more authoritative than Evans&#8217; site, but less entertaining.</div>
<p></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Evans describes his mission:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The purpose of this FAQ is to provide concise, authoritative rebuttals to nonsense about the U.S. tax system that is frequently posted on web sites scattered throughout the Internet, by a variety of fanatics, idiots, charlatans, and dupes, frequently referred to by the courts as “tax protesters”.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>In this FAQ, you will read many decisions of judges who refer to the views of tax protesters as “frivolous,” “ridiculous,” “absurd,” “preposterous,” or “gibberish.” If you don’t read a lot of judicial opinions, you may not understand the full weight of what it means when a judge calls an argument “frivolous” or “ridiculous.”</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>When a judge calls an argument “ridiculous” or “frivolous,” it is absolutely the worst thing the judge could say. It means that the person arguing the case has absolutely no idea of what he is doing, and has completely wasted everyone’s time. It doesn’t mean that the case wasn’t well argued, or that judge simply decided for the other side, it means that there was no other side. The argument was absolutely, positively, incompetent. The judge is not telling you that you that you were “wrong.” The judge is telling you that you are out of your mind.</p>
<p>This FAQ addresses only assertions that are frivolous, and only questions of law, not politics or economics. <b>It is not the purpose of this FAQ to criticize any opinion, or stifle any debate, about the proper scope or operation of the federal tax system.</b> For example, claims that the federal income tax is unfair, morally equivalent to theft, or bad economic policy are all matters of opinion, not law, and are outside the scope of this FAQ. However, a claim that the federal income tax is unconstitutional, unenforceable, or inapplicable is an assertion of law and is within the scope of this FAQ.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, as I tried to do when I wrote my survey of <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/08/31/the-truth-about-taxes/">the truth about taxes</a>, Evans isn&#8217;t arguing whether the tax system is fair or unfair &mdash; he&#8217;s just trying to explain the law.</p>
<p>The Tax Protester FAQ addresses dozens of faulty anti-tax arguments, offering context and legal background for each rebuttal. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#law">The Internal Revenue Code is not a law.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#wagesincome">Wages are not income.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#voluntary">The income tax is voluntary.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#W-4">If you don&#8217;t file a Form W-4, you can&#8217;t be taxed.</a></li>
<li>The ever-popular &#8220;the income tax is illegal because <a href="http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#ratification">the 16th Amendment wasn&#8217;t properly ratified</a>&#8221; argument.</li>
<li>And, perhaps my favorite: <a href="http://evans-legal.com/dan/tpfaq.html#cult">Is tax protesting a cult?</a>

<p>The Tax Protester FAQ is <i>l-o-n-g</i> and often dry. But if you&#8217;ve ever been fascinated by this topic (as I have), it&#8217;s well worth browsing. It gives a glimpse at how law works in the U.S., and shows the lengths some folks will go to escape paying taxes.</p>
<p>I know taxes suck. Nobody likes them, but they&#8217;re part of the price we pay to live in modern society. We wouldn&#8217;t have roads, bridges, schools, or law enforcement without them. And while I think we all should pay as little as we&#8217;re legally obligated, I think cheating on taxes is wrongheaded and unpatriotic.</p>
<p>Look, I have no problem with you complaining about taxes. That&#8217;s your right. <b>Play by the rules; if you don&#8217;t like the rules, then work to change them.</b> But don&#8217;t argue the rules don&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>Want to become a millionaire? Then perhaps you should start by studying the behaviors of people who have done it. But don’t worry – you don’t need to stop the next Mercedes you see and ask the driver intrusive questions, because two authors have done all the work for you. One of their findings: Most millionaires don’t drive a Mercedes.</p>

Written in 1996 by marketing professors William Danko and Thomas Stanley, its main premise is that <strong>people who look rich may not actually be rich</strong>; they overspend — often on symbols of wealth — but actually have modest portfolios and, sometimes, big debts. On the other hand, actual millionaires tend to live in middle-income neighborhoods, drive economical cars, wear simple watches, and buy suits off the rack.</p>
<p>You’ve likely heard of the book. You may be familiar with the premise. Perhaps you even read it way back when. But if you read it again — as I recently have — you’ll be reminded of some of true gems of wisdom Danko and Stanley gleaned from their thousands of surveys of millionaires.</p>
<p>To give you a taste, this post will highlight some of the timeless — along with the lesser-known — lessons of <em>The Millionaire Next Door</em> as well as Stanley’s 2009 book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470482559/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><em>Stop Acting Rich&#8230;and Start Living Like a Real Millionaire</em></a>. (A future post will feature my interview with Dr. Stanley.)</p>
<p><em><strong>Lesson #1: Income Does Not Equal Wealth</strong></em><br />
Yes, higher-income households tend to have more wealth than lower- and middle-income households. But the size of a paycheck explains only approximately 30% of the variation of wealth among households. What really matters is how much of the income is invested. <strong>On average, millionaires invest nearly 20% of their income.</strong></p>
<p>Danko and Stanley offer a formula for determining whether you have a net worth that is commensurate with your income:</p>
<blockquote><p>Multiply your age times your realized pretax annual household income from all sources except inheritances. Divide by 10. This, less any inherited wealth, is what your net worth should be.</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors rightly call it a “simple rule of thumb”; a more thorough analysis would look at lifetime income, not just the most recent year. Plus, it strikes me that it’s more accurate for people who are at least a couple of decades into their careers. It’s not realistic, for example, to think a 25-year-old who makes $30,000 would have accumulated $75,000 (25 x 30,000 ÷ 10). However, for those in their mid-40s and later to meet this metric, they would have needed to save 10% to 15% of their incomes throughout their careers, or started later but saved 20% to 25% of their incomes. That’s not common, but also not impossible.</p>
<p>The formula also helps in sorting out the millionaires-to-be and the millionaire-wannabes. Those in the top quartile of wealth accumulation are prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAWs), according to Danko and Stanley. Those in the bottom quartile are under accumulators of wealth (UAWs).</p>
<div class="highlight"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> We actually <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/12/20/finding-financial-benchmarks-and-milestones/">discussed this benchmark</a> here at Get Rich Slowly at the end of December. Many readers found the formula flawed for their circumstances.</div>
<p><em><strong>Lesson #2: Work That Budget</strong></em><br />
The majority of millionaires have a budget. Of those who don’t, they have what the authors called “an artificial economic environment of scarcity,” more commonly known as “<a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/11/04/how-to-save-putting-pay-yourself-first-into-practice/">pay yourself first</a>.” In other words, they invest a good chunk of their income before they can spend any of it.</p>
<p>As for those who do budget and plan out their expenses for the coming year, no, they don’t enjoy it any more than the rest of us. But they appreciate the “payoff,” as well as fear the consequences of not doing it. As the authors wrote, <strong>“It’s much easier to budget if you visualize the long-term benefits of this task.”</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Lesson #3: Know Where Your Dough Doth Go</strong></em><br />
Similar to the previous point, almost two-thirds of millionaires can answer “yes” to this question: “Do you know how much your family spends each year for food, clothing, and shelter?” In contrast, only 35% of high-income non-millionaires answered yes to this question. Millionaires are more likely to <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/22/track-every-penny-you-spend/">track their spending</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lesson #4: Know Where You Want Your Dough to Go</strong></em><br />
Another two-thirds of millionaires answered in the affirmative to this question: “Do you have a clearly defined set of daily, weekly, monthly, annual, and lifetime goals?” One example: a woman who wants to have $5 million by the age of 65, at which point she’ll retire. At the time of the book’s publication, she had already reached millionaire status — on an annual income of $90,000. As for those who answered “no” to the question, many of them are retired and have already reached their goal of <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/03/29/financial-independence-the-final-stage-of-money-management/">financial independence</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lesson #5: Time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is</span> Money</strong></em><br />
All this budgeting and goaling takes time, but millionaires are willing to spend it. <strong>Prodigious accumulators of wealth spend nearly twice as many hours per month planning their investments as under accumulators of wealth.</strong> The majority of PAWs agreed with the following statements, while the majority of UAWs did not:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I spend a lot of time planning my financial future.”</li>
<li>“Usually, I have sufficient time to handle my investments properly.”</li>
<li>“When it comes to the allocation of my time, I place the management of my assets before my other activities.”</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to earn a big six-figure salary for planning to pay off. In a survey of 854 middle-income workers, Danko and Stanley found “a strong positive correlation” between investment planning and wealth accumulation. This extra planning doesn’t just happen. According to the authors, “Most PAWs have a regimented planning schedule. Each week, each month, each year, they plan their investments.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Lesson #6: Love the Home You’re With</strong></em><br />
Your choice of home — and how often you choose a new one — will determine your ability to accumulate wealth. According to <em>The Millionaire Next Door</em>, that wealthy family has been next door for quite a while. Half of millionaires have lived in the same house for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>In <em>Stop Acting Rich</em>, Thomas Stanley digs deeper into how your address affects your spending, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Nothing has a greater impact on your wealth and your consumption than your choices of house and neighborhood.</strong> If you live in a high-price home in an exclusive community, you will spend more than you should and your ability to save and build wealth will be compromised…. [P]eople who live in million-dollar homes are not millionaires. They may be high-income producers but, by trying to emulate glittering rich millionaires, they are living a treadmill existence.</p></blockquote>
<p>He cites several statistics to back this up, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninety percent of millionaires live in homes valued below $1 million; 28.3% live in homes valued at $300,000 or less.</li>
<li>On average, millionaires have a mortgage that is less than one-third of the value of their homes.</li>
<li>If you really want to reduce your housing bill, join the 67,000 millionaires who live in mobile homes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re looking to buy a home, Stanley provides this advice: “The market value of the home you purchase should be less than three times your household’s total annual realized income.”</p>
<div class="highlight"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> J.D.&#8217;s <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/05/13/a-real-millionaire-next-door/">real millionaire next door</a> has been in the same house for fifty years.</div>
<p><em><strong>Lesson #7: Love the Spouse You’re With</strong></em><br />
The majority of wealthy people are married and stay married to the same person. Of course, marriage shouldn’t be just about money. We’re sure that 24-year-old Crystal Harris has other reasons for being engaged to 84-year-old Hugh Hefner; perhaps she loves his pipe. But several <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-01-18-marriagewealth_x.htm">studies have shown</a> that people who are married accumulate more wealth than those who are single or divorced.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to marry someone with the right financial habits. In the majority of millionaire households studied by Danko and Stanley, the husband is the main breadwinner and tends to be frugal, but the wife is even more frugal. As they wrote, “A couple cannot accumulate wealth if one of its members is a hyperconsumer.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Lesson #8: Don’t Drive Away Your Wealth</strong></em><br />
The majority of millionaires own their cars, rather than lease. Approximately a quarter have a current-year model, but another quarter drive a car that is four years old or older. More than a third tend to buy used vehicles. What is the most popular car maker among millionaires, according to <em>Stop Acting Rich</em>? Toyota.</p>
<p>So who’s driving all those BMWs and Mercedes-es? Not millionaires. <strong>Eighty-six percent of “prestige/luxury” cars are bought by non-millionaires.</strong> In fact, Stanley writes that “one in three people who traded in their old car for a new one were upside down and owed more on the trade-in than its market value.” It’s tough to get wealthy doing stuff like that.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lesson #9: The Rich Are Different — They’re Happier</strong></em><br />
At this point, you might be wondering whether all this living below your means is worth it. Sure, millionaires having bigger portfolios — but are they happier? Danko and Stanley’s research indicates that they are. According to their research, “Financially independent people are happier than those in their same income/age cohort who are not financially secure.”</p>
<p>First of all, PAWs worry less than UAWs. There’s a peace of mind that comes from living below your means and having money in the bank. But they also don’t expect “status” purchases to improve their happiness, because evidence shows it doesn’t happen. Among the people surveyed, those who drive a BMW and wear a Rolex are not happier than those who drive a Honda and wear a Timex.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Double-sided Benefits of Living Below Your Means</strong></em><br />
After reading these books, it occurred to me that there are actually <em>two</em> benefits of learning to live on much less than your paycheck.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first, of course, is that you can save more.</li>
<li>But secondly, it also means that you ultimately need to save less.</li>
</ul>
<p>Permit me to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Someone who makes $50,000 but lives on just $40,000 can contribute $10,000 a year to her nest egg, and can retire when that nest egg is big enough to generate — along with Social Security and other benefits — $40,000 a year. However, someone who makes $50,000 but spends, say, $48,000 is contributing just $2,000 to a portfolio that must eventually help provide $48,000 a year in retirement. In other words, she’s saving less yet needs to accumulate more.</p>
<p>Thus, when it comes to retirement planning, adopting the lifestyle of the “millionaire next door” means you can save more toward a lower-priced goal. That’s a formula that can help even non-millionaires achieve their retirement goals.</p>

<p>If there was a coat of arms for my family, it would display a golden lion standing on his back legs on a field of dark olive green. He would be clutching bags of gold coins in his front paws and, emblazoned across his chest would be three words: God, Family, and Thrift.</p>
<p>Thrift? Yes, that much maligned and oft misunderstood value.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newthrift.org/"><img src="http://www.newthrift.org/imagesN/NT-logo.gif" widht="214" height="49" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" alt="Thrift is an old idea for a new economy" title="Thrift is an old idea for a new economy" /></a>A forthcoming study by the John Templeton Center for Thrift and Generosity at the <a href="http://www.americanvalues.org/">Institute for American Values</a> shows that many Americans associate thrift with penny-pinching and money-hoarding. In the nationally representative sample, 54% of respondents believe that being generous is the opposite of being thrifty, and 48% of respondents think that if Americans became more thrifty, it would either hurt the economy or wouldn’t make much difference.</p>
<p>Try telling that to my family.</p>
<p><i><b>Thrift as a Family Value</b></i><br />
My grandfather Thor came to America amidst a background of gray sky and gray sea, in a ship tossed by waves with swells of white and blown by the wind. With limited funds, he took a train to Wisconsin to meet a distant uncle before saving enough to get to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he married Inga, the nurse he fell in love with in Norway and followed to the United States. Together they worked hard planting and harvesting, making rag rugs on the loom that Thor built, and saving much of the money they earned.</p>
<p>Children kept arriving and eventually numbered nine. After learning English, Thor went to work for a major newspaper in St. Paul. He worked hard to improve sales of the paper and he eventually became Circulation Manager. Meanwhile, Inga was at home, cleaning and combing wool before spinning it into yarn, which was used to make sweaters and mittens in traditional Norwegian design. Older children were taught to help out, and all the children learned to earn, save, and spend wisely. Because of Thor and Inga’s thrift, during the Depression they were able to take in relatives in trouble and foster children with no support.</p>
<p>Far from hurting their economic well-being, <b>thrift is the value that enabled my grandparents to enter the American middle class</b>. And now, after nearly fifty years of neglect, Americans are once again celebrating thrift.</p>
<p><i><b>National Thrift Week</b></i><br />
A once-vibrant social movement from 1916-1966, <a href="http://www.bringbackthriftweek.org/">National Thrift Week</a> is back, starting in Philadelphia and poised to go viral across America with its message that “thrift is the friend of sustainable prosperity, broad economic opportunity, beautiful neighborhoods, and a healthy planet.”</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/station/as-seen-on/Tip_of_the_Day_Kicks_Off_National_Thrift_Week_Philadelphia-114149629.html?__source=Watch%20This&#038;autoPlay=true">Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter officially proclaimed Thrift Week</a>, and 80 representatives from community organizations, businesses, churches, schools, and banks came together at the “Philadelphia Thrift Leaders Roundtable.” A Philadelphia credit union and charter school are renewing an old Thrift Week tradition by inviting students to open school <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/03/21/which-online-high-yield-savings-account-is-best/">savings accounts</a>.</p>
<div align="center"><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="560" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cv8PcRZzSRw" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe><br /><i>The mayor of Philadelphia kicks off Thrift Week.</i></div>
<p></p>
<p><b>As the organizer of the only “Thrift Club” in the country, I find that many Americans aren’t even familiar with the word “thrift.”</b> When I extend an invitation to a Thrift Club meeting at the Chanhassen Public Library, I&#8217;m met with a politely blank stare and the question, “What’s a Thrift Club?” My daughter, a librarian, suggested that I change the name to  the “Simple Living Club,” which is a chic idea nowadays, and could describe the variety of topics our club discusses &mdash; from <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/01/30/gardening-101-plan-today-for-summer-success/">home gardening</a> and <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/08/21/the-joys-of-home-canning/">food preservation</a> to achieving “greener” homes to having <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/10/07/a-practical-wedding/">low-cost, meaningful weddings</a> to <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/05/26/be-more-involved-in-your-financial-planning/">financial planning</a> and volunteerism.</p>
<p>But the word “thrift” can’t be replaced.  For one thing, the root of the word “thrift” is “thrive,” and “to thrive” perfectly captures what the thrift ethic is about. While many people erroneously associate thrift with being miserly, cheap, or stingy, look up “thrift” in the dictionary and you’ll see that it is more  accurately described as prosperity, thriving, healthy and vigorous growth,  careful management (especially of money), and gainful employment. <b>Thrift is not simply a money saving strategy &mdash; it’s a broad term that encompasses the wise use of all resources: health, time, money, and environment included.</b> Thrift is a way of life, an ethic, a philosophy that enables ordinary people like Thor and Inga to be generous and to live the good life.</p>
<p><i><b>The Apostle of Thrift</b></i><br />
<img src="http://www.getrichslowly.org/images/apostleofthrift.jpg" width="200" height="268" alt="" title="Ben Franklin, Apostle of Thrift &mdash; image from the book Thrift: A Cyclopedia, copyright 2008 by Templeton Press. Used with permission." align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" style="border:0px;" />Ben Franklin’s life is the perfect example. Known as the “Apostle of Thrift,” Franklin penned numerous proverbs about “industry and frugality.” However, because he wasted no time or money in his early life, he retired early, donated his money to create libraries and fire departments, and attended plays and ate fine French food while acting as a public servant in France. </p>
<p>John Adams, who also served in France, accused Franklin of hypocrisy, but as social historian <a href="http://www.templetonpress.org/news.asp?n=58">Barbara Dafoe Whitehead</a> points out in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1599471485/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><i>Franklin’s Thrift: the Lost History of an American Virtue</i></a>, Franklin was just enjoying <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/06/29/why-we-scrimp-and-save-the-rewards-of-frugality-and-thrift/">the fruits of his thrift</a>. </p>
<p>Rather than inhibiting people, thrift can help contemporary Americans achieve the prosperity that their ancestors came to find. As our leaders seek answers on how to build a more sustainable economy, they would do well to be guided by that venerable word “thrift” &mdash; an idea both old and new.</p>

He&#8217;s eager to support their aims &mdash; but wishes the group were a bit more organized.</div>

<p>When a friend of mine changed jobs recently, she discovered she had half a dozen old 401(k)s trailing her from her past jobs. She wanted to get on top of her financial planning, but wasn&#8217;t sure what to do with all those old investments. she asked me for advice.</p>
<p>Truth is, I wasn&#8217;t sure either. I cashed out my one 401(k) to buy a house several years ago. I know that was a dumb move in the larger financial story of my life. <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/01/24/the-most-important-factor-in-retirement-savings/">Saving early for retirement</a> is one of the best ways to build wealth. I can&#8217;t undo it now, though, and I&#8217;ve been so focused on paying off debts I haven&#8217;t thought much about retirement planning for years.</p>
<p>As my <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/09/02/help-my-debt-snowball-is-melting/">debt burden shrinks</a>, it&#8217;s time to start thinking about my own investment strategy. So I looked into  my friend&#8217;s question: What should she do with those old 401Ks?</p>
<p><i><b>What To Do with Old 401(k)s</b></i><br />
According to Schwab, there are <a href="http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/research_strategies/market_insight/retirement_strategies/planning/what_to_do_with_your_401k_when_you_change_jobs.html">four basic things you can do</a> with a 401(k) when you leave a job. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Take the cash.</b> You can cash out your 401(k) and pocket the money. This is basically Bad Plan Theater, though, unless you&#8217;re unemployed and otherwise destitute. Cashing out your 401(k) at any time before retirement is a permanent hit to your future wealth. You can regain the savings at a future job, of course, but you&#8217;ll never regain the time you lost earning interest on those savings. The dollars you put into your 401(k) when you&#8217;re 25 are worth much, much more to you than the dollars you put in when you&#8217;re 40. You want to let your investments age as long as possible before you need to withdraw that money. In addition, you pay 28% in taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty for taking your money out of your 401(k). The fees and taxes make this an even worse idea &mdash; no matter how tempting it is.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Do nothing.</b> If you do nothing with your 401K, it&#8217;ll just sit there <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/04/02/the-extraordinary-power-of-compound-interest/">accruing interest</a> (or investment returns) on whatever money was in it when you stopped contributing. This keeps your money in the same investment plan it was already in, with the same terms and fees. This might be the best option for some people: if your new employer doesn&#8217;t have a retirement plan you like, or if you&#8217;re starting your own business and want to keep your 401(k) unchanged.</li>

<li><b>Rollover your 401(k) to your new employer&#8217;s retirement plan.</b> This is the best option for most people. You can do it without penalty, unlike when you cash out the 401(k). Rolling over your 401(k) keeps things simple. All your investments are in one place, where you can easily keep track of how they&#8217;re doing. In addition, all your new retirement contributions will be adding to the pot you&#8217;ve rolled over from your previous job. You&#8217;ll be limited to your new employer&#8217;s investment plans and options, though, so be sure to read the fine print carefully and make sure you like their offerings as much as what you have at your old place.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Rollover your 401(k) into a personal IRA.</b> This option gives you the most flexibility. You can put your investments anywhere you like, without being restricted to your employer&#8217;s plans. It might be the only choice for people becoming self-employed, other than leaving your 401(k) where it is. On the downside, moving your funds to an IRA may have less protection from creditors than a 401(k), and may carry an annual fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>One more option: You may be able to <a href="http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/can-you-roth-ira-rollover-rules-from-401k/">roll your 401(k) over into a Roth IRA</a>, as Jeff Rose explains at <a href="http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/">Good Financial Cents</a>. A <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/06/07/how-to-start-a-roth-ira-and-where-to-do-it/">Roth IRA</a> lets you deposit post-tax dollars and then withdraw money tax-free after retirement. In general, you&#8217;ll pay less tax on your retirement funds by funding a Roth IRA than a traditional IRA or 401(k). Making the switch to a Roth IRA from a 401(k) can be a little tricky, and the amount of funds you can do this with is limited. You may want to consult a financial professional if you&#8217;re planning to take this option.</p>
<p><i><b>Putting Theory into Practice</b></i><br />
After looking at all the options, I advised my friend to consolidate her old 401(k)s into one 401(k) account with her new employer, and to keep contributing to her Roth IRA as well as her 401(k). She can put up to $5,000 a year into her Roth IRA, and her remaining retirement funds into her 401(k). That&#8217;s not expert advice &mdash; it&#8217;s just what makes sense to me after looking into the options. Depending on your individual situation and your employer&#8217;s 401(k) offerings, you may find a different approach works best for you.</p>
<p>When I start up my retirement savings again (hopefully this year!), I&#8217;ll be following a similar tactic: setting up a Roth IRA and investing in that account first. Anything above the annual deposit limits that we can save will go into my husband&#8217;s 401(k).</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m just starting out at this, I&#8217;m even more interested than usual in your experiences. <b>What have you done with old retirement accounts when you&#8217;ve changed jobs? What types of accounts do you rely on for your retirement savings?</b></p>

<p>Despite the best laid plans of mice and men, there are times when the unforeseeable just waltzes into your life and poops on your budget. Sure you have a budget of $400 a month for groceries. But then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your brother and sister-in-law and their four kids came for a week.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Or when you least expect it, your best friend announces she’s getting married and you have to find a way to pay for a $200 dress.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Or you find out your kid is failing math and the only way to pull his butt out of the fire is with a tutor that’ll cost you $60 a week.</li>
</ul>
<p>Friends and family can be your worst enemies when it comes to staying on a budget. It can be a real struggle not giving into to the pressure to go out for dinner, see a movie, or come to a shopping-party where you’ll be expected to lay out some dough. They aren’t trying to mess up your budget, they just want to have fun. And it can be frustrating to watch your pals say they’ve trimmed their budgets even as they head out for a day of mall grazing.</p>
<p><i><b>The Curveball Account</b></i><br />
One of the best ways to cope with life’s constant financial challenges is to have a Curveball Account. This isn&#8217;t your <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/08/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund/">emergency fund</a>, which you need for major disasters. This is just a slush fund from which you can draw when unexpected expenses come whizzing at you at 60 miles an hour and you don’t want to throw your budget totally off track. Whether you deposit a little or a lot into this account every month, it can be a real budget-saver.</p>
<p>And if you move all the money you “save” by shopping smartly into this account right after you haven’t spent it, it’ll grow even faster. So the next time you save 50¢ on a coupon, go home and drop that 50¢ into an &#8220;I’m-a-Smart-Shopper Jar&#8221; and then deposit all those savings to your Curveball Account at the end of the month.</p>
<p>If your slip is minor, you can always cut back on something else in the short-term to get things back on track. So that’ll be less coffee or you’ll take a pass on a night out with the boy so you can rebalance. But if the expense is a whopper &mdash; a major car repair when you simply haven’t accumulated enough in your car-repair account &mdash; you may have to borrow from your emergency fund to pay the bill. Then you’ll have to trim your spending throughout your budget so you can crank up the automatic transfers to your emergency fund to get it back to where it was.</p>
<p><i><b>Short-Term Cutbacks</b></i><br />
Over-spending may mean you’ll have to balance by under-spending: All those things you routinely buy each day may have to go. Here are some other ways to compensate for over-spending:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Spend Days are becoming increasingly popular among the frugal set as a way to focus on where the money is going by eliminating the automatic itch to spend. Assigning one day a week as a no-spend day may wake you up to all the ways money disappears, while shoring up your bank account.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Use those points you’ve accumulated on your loyalty cards for things that you would normally have to buy so you can use that money to start or boost your Curveball Account. Airmile points can be redeemed by grocery coupons. Use the coupons for grocery shopping and use your grocery money to boost your Curveball Account.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Give up a vice for one month: no wine, no beer, no ciggies, no candy-bars, no potato chips, no __________________ (insert your weakness here). Once you have the $75, $150, $500 you think you need in your Curveball account, you can go back to your vice if you really want to.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Sell something. Y’know that sewing machine you never use, that guitar you never play, that exercise bike you never ride? Wouldn’t you rather have the money in a Curveball Account so you’re not twisted in knots every time something unexpected comes at you? Have a <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/06/12/a-yard-sale-checklist-ten-tips-for-garage-sale-prep/">garage sale</a>, take your stuff to a consignment shop, sell it on e-bay or <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/02/01/24-craigslist-tips-tricks-and-resources/">Craigslist</a>. Bank the money.</li>

Tenets like spending within your means and never carrying a balance on a high-interest credit card apply across the board. But how can you know if you’re making any serious financial slip-ups for your current age?</p>
<p>Here are some tips to avoid costly money mistakes when you’re in your 20s, 30s, and 40s. I’ll also share a secret method you can use to learn about money and wealth (or about any subject, for that matter) that’s quick, easy, and maybe even kind of fun!</p>
<p><i><b>20-Somethings: The Three Mistakes to Watch Out For</b></i><br />
If you’re in your twenties, it’s likely that you’re staying in school longer, putting off moving out of your parents’ home, or delaying marriage and children. You have high expectations for a career that pays well, suits your lifestyle, and inspires you get out of bed each morning. Dramatically improve your financial health by avoiding these three serious money mistakes that can come back to bite you later on:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Accumulating <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/11/16/how-to-get-out-of-debt-2/">credit-card debt</a>.</b> Now that you’re a working adult, you might think that you’re entitled to lots of new clothes, nights out on the town, and vacations. The problem is that financing a lifestyle that you can’t afford using a credit card is a terrible financial move. It’s a grim mistake that sticks with you for years and will only get worse as interest accrues each month that you don’t pay off the balance.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Ditching participation in a 401(k).</b> You might be hesitant to start contributing to a workplace retirement plan (like a 401(k) or a 403(b)) if you aren’t sure how long you’re going to stay in your job, but letting that stop you from contributing &mdash; especially when you’re offered free matching funds &mdash; is a big mistake. <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/01/24/the-most-important-factor-in-retirement-savings/">Contribute 10% to 15% of your income</a> and then roll it over into an IRA or a retirement plan at your new employer after you leave the job. No one wants to feel behind; start contributing today and you won’t wake up in your 30s with big financial regrets.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Not seeking professional advice.</b> Don’t think that you have to be self-sufficient when it comes to handling your money. Get help from a professional &mdash; like a Registered Investment Advisor, a financial planner, or a <a href="http://www.smartmovestogrowrich.com">financial coach</a> &mdash; to figure out how to set and achieve your unique goals.
</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>30-Somethings: The Three Mistakes to Watch Out For</b></i><br />
If you’re past 30, you might be starting a family, moving into a larger home, and climbing up a career ladder. During this life stage you need to stay focused on your goals and make sure you can provide for your family if you lose your job or business. Shore up your financial defenses by avoiding these three financial oversights:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Forgetting about an <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/08/how-to-start-an-emergency-fund/">emergency fund</a>.</b> Add up your monthly living expenses and multiply that number by six to figure the <i>minimum</i> amount you should keep on hand in an FDIC-insured <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/03/21/which-online-high-yield-savings-account-is-best/">savings account</a>. Depending on your job stability, industry, and family situation, you might need to have a year or more of emergency savings stashed away. Doing this will ensure you’re protected in case something unexpected arises (like an illness or job loss) and that you’ll be able to keep your life plans on track.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Skimping on retirement savings.</b> As you begin to earn more money, it might be tempting to spend more on fun trips, fancy cars, and designer clothes. Treating your extra money carelessly and not increasing your contributions to a workplace retirement plan, an IRA, or to both is a mistake. You might also have higher expenses now, but you still need to carve out enough from your budget to keep long-term goals like retirement and paying for a child’s education on track.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Not being properly insured.</b> Having enough of the right kinds of insurance is an easy way to reduce risk and ensure that you and your family can get through unexpected hardships like an illness, accident, or death. Insurance doesn’t help you build wealth, but it certainly helps you protect it.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>40-Somethings: The Three Mistakes to Watch Out For</b></i><br />
If you’re a parent in your 40s, you might be looking forward to launching your kids out of the house, doing a happy dance, and refocusing on your own financial needs. This life stage is a great time to simplify your finances and reevaluate your retirement dreams. Don’t let these 3 money mistakes trip you up:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Failing to focus on retirement.</b> Though you probably have about two decades to go before retirement, you’re getting closer and need to take it more seriously. Enter your information into a retirement calculator at sites like <a href="http://www.aarp.org">aarp.org</a> and <a href="http://www.dinkytown.com">dinkytown.com</a> to make sure you’re putting enough money aside each month.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Not eliminating debt.</b> In addition to saving for retirement, free up as much discretionary income as possible to send extra payments to your debt. <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/11/16/how-to-get-out-of-debt-2/">Getting rid of debt</a> sooner rather than later saves a huge amount of interest and allows you to squirrel away even more for retirement during your 40s and 50s.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Ignoring “teachable” moments.</b> Instead of allowing older children to drain your bank account, teach them how to earn and manage their own money. Help them create a job resume, open a bank account, stick to a budget, set savings goals, and invest for retirement. Even minors can open up and contribute to an IRA as soon as they get their first part-time job!</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>A Secret to Learning About Money and Wealth</b></i><br />

<p>Here’s my secret for the best way to learn about money: <b>Make getting the information fit into your lifestyle.</b></p>
<p>If you love being on the computer, subscribe to Get Rich Slowly so you never miss a post. If you like reading during your lunch break or while you travel, regularly read personal-finance books, such as J.D.&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596809409/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><i>Your Money: The Missing Manual</i></a> or my own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312662629/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/"><i>Money Girl’s Smart Moves to Grow Rich</i></a>.

If you spend way too much time in the car or don’t want to get chatty during your pedicure, listen to a money podcast. If you need to be entertained while you’re on the&#8230;in the&#8230;you know &mdash; take a money magazine with you.</p>
<p>You get the idea. See where you have time to squeeze in 15 or 30 minutes of reading or listening about money and you’ll be amazed at how easy it is to take your financial game to a new level, build wealth, and get rich slowly.</p>

<p>Though I&#8217;ve been a GRS reader since early 2007, I&#8217;ve largely been a quiet observer. I&#8217;ve often wanted to participate more actively in the discussion and community that J.D has established over the years, but for whatever reason, I never have.  </p>
<p>But recently, when J.D. wrote about <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/11/18/getting-started-with-mint/">the Mint.com signup process</a>, I finally felt I might have some unique insight to offer. In particular, it was his comment below that brought me to the keyboard to contribute:</p>
<blockquote><p>The [Mint.com] Budgets section lets you, well, erect a budget to keep your spending focused. I haven’t had time to play around here, so I can’t comment on its utility. <b>I’m hoping that Mint will allow me to put my beloved Balanced Money Formula (or some other broad budget framework) into use.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Since I use <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint</a> for this very purpose &mdash; putting the beloved Balanced Money Formula into use &mdash; I wanted to share my approach in detail.</p>
<p><i><b>Finding the Middle Way</b></i><br />
Prior to learning about The Balanced Money Formula on GRS, I regularly struggled to find the level of detail at which I should budget, a decision I know many of us deal with at some point or another. In my search to find &#8220;<a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/11/09/do-what-works-for-you/">what works for me</a>&#8220;, I flirted with the budgeting extremes.</p>
<p>When I started to budget, <b>I tried to allocate and track every dollar I spent using very specific (read restrictive) categories. You probably won&#8217;t be surprised to learn that this system quickly crumbled.</b> Maintaining such a detailed budget took far too much time and didn&#8217;t really provide me with much meaningful data for analysis.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, frustrated by failing in my first attempt, <b>I completely stopped in my effort to track my spending&#8230;at any level of detail. This wasn&#8217;t a very effective approach either.</b></p>
<p>When J.D. reviewed the <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/10/27/the-balanced-money-formula/">Balanced Money Formula</a> a while back, I saw it as &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_way">The Middle Way</a>&#8221; of budgeting. It&#8217;s not so detailed that your budget strains under its own weight, but it&#8217;s also just structured enough so that it provides instructive data that can help you to course correct your spending and saving habits when necessary.  (Hmm&#8230;The Middle Way of budgeting. Perhaps J.D. is my personal finance Buddha!)</p>
<p>As a quick recap from J.D. (who got this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743269888/ref=nosim/getrichslo-20/">from Elizabeth Warren</a>), The Balanced Money Formula suggests that &#8220;ideally, no more than 50% of your paycheck should be spent on Needs (and keeping them below 35% is best). Of the remaining amount, at least 20% should be devoted to Saving, while up to 30% can be spent on Wants.&#8221;</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/10/27/the-balanced-money-formula/"><img src="http://www.getrichslowly.org/images/balancedmoneyformula.jpg" width="273" height="135" alt="" title="The Balanced Money Formula, from All Your Worth by Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Tyagi" style="border:0px;" /></a></div>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>Finding the Middle Way with Mint</b></i><br />
Since The Balanced Money Formula is tremendously flexible and easy to implement, you could certainly use an off-line method to manage it (<i>e.g.</i>, Excel spreadsheet, ledger, etc.); however, I&#8217;ve found Mint to be a great tool for this framework, mainly because it automatically brings in my debit and credit card transactions for categorization, a major time-saver.</p>
<p>When Mint brings in your transactions, it works to automatically select an applicable category, often with mixed success. (Sometimes my monthly train/subway pass is read as Subway and posts as a Fast Food transaction!) However, if you have regular interactions with the same vendor (Gas Station, Grocery Store), you can apply rules such that a specific category is automatically, and more accurately, applied. Or, for more <i>ad hoc</i> transactions, you can manually select the appropriate category.</p>
<p>As for categories, Mint has many to choose from &mdash; perhaps too many. The image below doesn&#8217;t quite do them justice, as each of the categories has a number of subcategories as well.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that Needs, Wants, and Savings are not in the standard list of categories. As a result, you&#8217;ll need to create them in order to establish your Balanced Money Formula system.</p>
<p>Creating new categories is easy.</p>
<p>On the Transactions tab, select a transaction and the &#8220;Category&#8221; drop-down. From the &#8220;Uncategorized&#8221; Category, select &#8220;Add/Edit Categories&#8221;, and on the following screen, select &#8220;Add a new category&#8221; to create Needs, Wants, and Savings, etc.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/mint-menu.jpg" width="200" height="327" alt="The Balanced Money Formula in Mint!" title="The Balanced Money Formula in Mint!" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/mint-categories.jpg" width="300" height="325" alt="The Balanced Money Formula in Mint!" title="The Balanced Money Formula in Mint!" /></div>
<p></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve created your new categories (I also use a Giving subcategory to track my charitable donations), it&#8217;s time to review your transactions and to bucket them accordingly.</p>
<p>A few caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve found that <b>the usefulness of Mint in categorizing your transactions is directly correlated to the percentage of your spending that is on a debit or credit card</b>.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Check transactions are also easy enough to manage. But if you primarily use cash, this process will be slightly more difficult (unless of course you keep detailed notes on your spending. I do not).</li>
<p></p>
<li>Since I mostly use a credit card, I assume that any cash I get from the ATM is going to a Want and not a Need (probably not 100% accurate, but it&#8217;s close enough for the Middle Way).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve updated your transactions, for at least a month of historical data, you&#8217;re now ready to review your spending against targeted budget levels. There are two ways to conduct this review.</p>
<p><i><b>Trends</b></i><br />
Select the Trends tab and choose the Spending Graph (By Category).</p>
<div align="center"><img src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/mint-spendinggraph1.jpg" width="500" height="250" alt="The Balanced Money Formula in Mint!" title="The Balanced Money Formula in Mint!" /></div>
<p></p>
<p>At first glance, doesn&#8217;t look so great, does it? One solid block of Uncategorized spending. Really useful, Geoff! Fortunately, Mint enables you to easily drill into the subcategories we just created.</p>
<p>Clicking the chart refreshes the data and shows your spending by Balanced Money Formula subcategory.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="http://www.jdroth.com/GRS/mint-spendinggraph2.jpg" width="450" height="267" alt="The Balanced Money Formula in Mint!" title="The Balanced Money Formula in Mint!" /></div>
<p></p>
<p>With this update, you can now quickly review your spending in the high-level categories and assess how well you&#8217;re tracking to budget. As you can see in the above, my Savings are well on track this month; but then again, my rent check hasn&#8217;t been cashed yet, so the picture will certainly change by month-end.</p>
<p>If you want a more precise understanding of the data, mouse over a section of the pie chart to see the number of transactions and your overall spending in the category (including % of total spending).</p>
<p>Compare these results to your budgeted percentage and you&#8217;re on the Middle Way.</p>
<p><i><b>Budgets</b></i><br />
For those wanting even more precision &mdash; mainly the ability to track to specific dollar budgets each month for each category &mdash; you can use Mint&#8217;s Budgets functionality. While I won&#8217;t review this functionality in detail, as the Trends view largely provides me with the level of detail I require, some may be interested in this view.</p>
<p>Based on the percentages you&#8217;re targeting (converted to dollars), create budgets for each of the Balanced Money Formula subcategories. Mint will now track your spending (through categorized transactions) to your budgets throughout the month, providing another visual reminder of how well you&#8217;re keeping to plan.</p>

<p></p>
<p><i><b>A Final Meditation</b></i><br />
While rich data and glossy charts from Mint are interesting to look at, and can indeed provide helpful insights and motivation, it&#8217;s important to remember that they&#8217;re only part of the solution. This approach is only useful if it helps guide you toward making improved spending and saving decisions which are more fully aligned with your goals and objectives.</p>
<p>With that, and with these tools and approach at your disposal, I hope you too are now on your way to finding budgeting nirvana by walking the Middle Way with GRS, the Balanced Money Formula, and Mint.</p>

<p>Ian and I spent six hours on Saturday pruning blackberry banes, trimming the arborvitae hedge, taking down Christmas lights, and more. He was a willing and competent worker. I think this experiment was a win-win for everyone involved.</p>
<p><i><b>You and Your Work</b></i><br />
Ian&#8217;s excellent work ethic reminded me of a short film I watched recently. It&#8217;s been a while since I highlighted any of these old movies about personal finance; it&#8217;s tough to find new ones I haven&#8217;t featured before. In fact, new readers may not even be aware that I love old instructional films of all sorts, but particularly if they&#8217;re about finance and related topics. I&#8217;ve shared many of these movies in the past, and I hope to find more to share in the future.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s film was put out by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronet_Films">Coronet Films</a> in 1948. In <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/you_and_your_work"><i>You and Your Work</i></a>, a young man learns the value of a positive attitude. Why loathe your life as a shoe salesman when you can <i>love</i> it? </p>

<p></p>
<p>High-school student Frank Taylor wants to earn some spending cash, so he takes a job as a shoe salesman. (Kind of <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/10/09/comic-book-ad-from-1956-how-i-made-a-small-fortune-in-spare-time/">like this</a>, but in a store.) The job is okay at first, but gradually Frank grows tired of it. Plus, the pay sucks: &#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t buy many of the things I wanted. The shoe business was no good!&#8221; After Frank is fired at the shoe store, he goes to his high-school guidance counselor for help.</p>
<p><i>You and Your Work</i> argues that there&#8217;s no such thing as a dull job. What&#8217;s important is the worker&#8217;s attitude. Frank wants a glamorous, interesting job &mdash; like an architect &mdash; but his counselor points out that even architects get bored with their work. And even teachers, chemists, and fishermen can be proud of what they do. So, too, can a shoe salesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any job is as important as <i>you</i> make it,&#8221; says the guidance counselor. &#8220;If you think it&#8217;s not important, whatever it is, you&#8217;ll soon become bored with it and do it poorly.&#8221;</p>
<p>To enjoy your work, you don&#8217;t need just a good income. You also need personal satisfaction, pride of accomplishment, and a sense of importance to others. This is true whether you&#8217;re talking about a part-time job or a life-time career. &#8220;And as for money,&#8221; says the counselor, &#8220;well, we all want money. But if you don&#8217;t perform any service, or if you don&#8217;t do your work well, you can&#8217;t expect much in return.&#8221;</p>
<p><i><b>The Worst Job I Ever Had</b></i><br />
I can relate to poor Frank Taylor&#8217;s position. His shoe-selling experience reminds me of <b><a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/15/the-worst-job-i-ever-had/">the worst job I ever had</a></b>, selling insurance door-to-door when I was fresh out of college. In my case, I was able to get things turned around &mdash; eventually. And Frank, too, comes out ahead. He changes his attitude, and, in fact, becomes manager of the shoe store.</p>
<p>As I say, I love these old films. Sure, they simplify things. And sometimes their notions are sexist and/or racist, or otherwise outdated. But generally they have sound messages, even for the kids of today. They&#8217;re just dressed in the trappings of a world that no longer exists.</p>
<p>Someday I&#8217;ll find the time to do a round-up of all these old educational money movies. I&#8217;d love to have them all in one place.</p>

<p>Linda is the most recent GRS reader with a relationship issue. She wrote to ask how to get her boyfriend motivated to save money. Here&#8217;s her story:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>How do I get someone motivated about saving money and being more frugal?</b> Is it even possible?</p>
<p>My fiance and I are pretty different when it comes to money. I&#8217;m the Saver, and he&#8217;s the Spender. I&#8217;m all about the future, and he&#8217;s more about the present. He changed a lot after we got together, and now that we&#8217;re saving for a wedding, he has definitely cut back on most of the big expenses.</p>
<p>But I get frustrated that although he speaks of saving money and of eventually buying a house, he&#8217;s always wanting to eat out, to get the latest gadgets (he&#8217;s switched cell phones three times in two years, and bought a MacBook and an iPad), and to go on vacation. He&#8217;s a poster child for the latte factor: He has a gold card from Starbucks, which shows how much he frequents it.</p>
<p>His last job had really good pay, but not his current one, so that may also contribute to the spending habit. (He&#8217;s used to what he used to spend and hasn&#8217;t made the adjustment.) I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m just giving him a hard time, or if there&#8217;s just some thing I&#8217;m not doing right. Do you have any advice?
</p></blockquote>
<p>First, Linda needs to know that it <i>is</i> possible for a Spender to become a Saver. I was a Spender for decades, but my wife is a Saver. In fact, Kris could have written this e-mail twenty years ago. Now, though, I&#8217;ve changed. I still have Spender tendencies (do they ever go away?), but they&#8217;re over-ruled by my new Saver habits.</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t get here overnight. It took time. And there were a lot of missteps along the way.</p>
<p>I made plenty of false starts toward frugality during the late nineties and early aughts, but I didn&#8217;t <i>really</i> change until I hit rock bottom. When we bought our house in 2004, I was overwhelmed by my debt and expenses. It was then that I was finally ready to &#8220;find religion&#8221;.</p>
<p>From the folks I&#8217;ve talked to, that&#8217;s a common theme: It&#8217;s tough to get somebody else to change until they&#8217;re ready to change. The motivation has to come from within. The question, then, is <b>how do you inspire somebody to change their financial habits?</b> I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any one right answer. (But maybe readers can share what worked for them, or what worked for the people they know.)</p>
<p>Now, goals keep me going. I&#8217;ve learned that there are trade-offs. Sure, I want to buy books and comics and gadgets and expensive restaurant meals. And I <i>do</i> buy some of these things. But once I sat down and decided what was most important to me, it became easier for me to save.</p>
<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been using travel as an example. I love to travel. Like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004658/quotes">George Bailey</a>, I want to see the world. Because this goal is always with me (and I literally think of it every hour of every day now), it&#8217;s easy for me to make smarter choices. In fact, it motivates me to find <i>new</i> ways to save.</p>
<p><b>So, how can Linda help her boyfriend save money and become more frugal?</b> I think she has to find a way to show him how his present choices affect his future options. Talk with him about what his big goals are &mdash; does he want to travel? own a business? go back to school? &mdash; and then discuss what it takes to get there. Until he understands that what he does today affects what he can do tomorrow, he&#8217;s not likely to change. (One sneaky way to try to get the point across is for Linda to talk about one of <i>her</i> goals, asking her boyfriend to help her figure out how to achieve it &mdash; even if she knows the answer already.)</p>
<p>What do <i>you</i> think? <b>How do you motivate a spouse or partner to become better with money?</b> For years, Kris tried to help me see the light, but I wasn&#8217;t ready. What could she have done differently? What can Linda do to help her boyfriend?</p>
