Your site speed should be a priority as slow sites decrease customer satisfaction and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-push-to-speed-up-your-web-site-42177">research</a> has shown that an improvement in site speed can increase conversions.</p> <p>To better understand how fast the web is (as of February 2011), I collected site speed data from approximately 100 different sites. This data allowed me to create a very close approximation of the equation that Google currently uses to report (in Webmaster Tools) how fast sites are relative to each other:</p> <div>y = 122.32e<sup>-0.31x</sup></div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>In this equation, x is the time it takes your page to load (in seconds)  and the result, y is approximately the percent of pages that your page  is faster than. If you grab your load time from Google Webmaster Tools,  you can use this equation to gauge how fast you are compared to the rest of the  web. If you don&rsquo;t want to bust out your calculator, grab this <a href="http://www.distilled.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Site-Speed-Calculator.xlsx"> spreadsheet </a>and use the calculator I set up.This equation is charted in the graph below.</div> <p><img width="615" height="333" alt="site speed load equation" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/page speed load time equation.png" /></p> <p>The x axis in this graph shows the page load time (in seconds) and the y axis represents the per cent of sites that the corresponding time is faster than. So if a page loads in 4.3 seconds, it is faster than 31% of other pages on the web.</p> <div>This data set allowed me to view the following data points:</div><div>&nbsp;</div> <ul>     <li>If your site loads in 5 seconds it is faster than approximately 25% of the web</li>     <li>If your site loads in 2.9 seconds it is faster than approximately 50% of the web</li>     <li>If your site loads in 1.7 seconds it is faster than approximately 75% of the web</li><li>If your site loads in 0.8 seconds it is faster than approximately 94% of the web</li>      </ul> <div>So now that you can test how you stack up to the rest of the web, the next question becomes how do you compare to your competitors. You can check this pretty easily a couple different ways. <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">Web Page Test</a> is a good web interface you can use to check page speed and <a href="http://www.showslow.org/Main_Page">Show Slow</a> has automated tracking tools that let you continually monitor pages.&nbsp;I really like using Web Page Test as you can set the location to San Jose (fairly close to Mountain View).</div><div>&nbsp;</div> <div><h2>How Important is Site Speed?</h2></div> <div><strong>My interpretation of what Google has said</strong></div> <div>At this point, the question becomes how important is load time. While increasing your site speed is really important and should be done for the user&rsquo;s experience, it can also improve your conversion rate, this section will only look at how page speed affects SEO.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>If we look at Google&rsquo;s <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">official blog post</a> announcing site speed as a factor, we read:</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>&ldquo;While site speed is a new signal, it doesn't carry as much weight as the relevance of a page. Currently, fewer than 1% of search queries are affected by the site speed signal&rdquo;</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>I think this means that site speed will affect only queries where other ranking signals are very close or when the load time is exceptionally poor. If competing pages have high <a href="../../../labs/lda">relevancy</a> scores and close link metrics (which isn&rsquo;t probable), page speed may come into play. Additionally, I believe that site speed could negatively hurt you if your page takes an excruciatingly painful amount of time to load.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Matt Cutts was nice enough to <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/site-speed/">blog</a> about this topic when he was on vacation and added onto the above statement with:</div> <div>&ldquo;That means that even fewer search results are affected, since the average search query is returning 10 or so search results on each page.&rdquo;</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Basically, this isn&rsquo;t going to shake up the top ten; when it is seen, it will probably be seen in keywords ranking much lower than the top ten.</div><div>&nbsp;</div> <div><h2>My Unscientific Experiment</h2></div> <div>I decided to do a bit of unscientific research, I took a few of the <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/09/google-search-zeitgeist-2010/">most</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/29/top-bing-search-terms-2010_n_789370.html#s193696&amp;title=undefined">popular</a> search terms for 2010 (iPad, chatroulette, free, <a href="http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/14078/slide_14078_193695_large.jpg?1297887459321">Justin Bieber</a>) as well as two keywords that get a lot of link love (here, home) and collected the load time for the top 20 results of each keyword. The data ranged from 1.062 to 58.881 seconds.</div> <div><img width="489" height="302" alt="speed of search results" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/speed of search results.png" /></div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>As you can see in the above chart, there are some REALLY&nbsp;slow sites ranking in the top 20. I&nbsp;wanted  to see if these sites just happened to be running slow at the time or  if a second measurement would show that the slow sites are really faster. A week after I&nbsp;took the original measurements, I&nbsp;re-timed  any page with a time over 15 seconds (which totaled 18 pages). While  some sites showed significant variance the majority did not change that  much. The average change was an improvement of 1.72 seconds, or 4%.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The average site speed for the 120 different results was 9.58 seconds while the standard deviation for this data set was 9.86 seconds.</div> <div><img width="615" height="312" alt="site speed distribution" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/page speed normal distribution.jpg" /></div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>According to the normalized distribution (as well as simply looking at the data), you are categorically slow if your page takes more than 19.44 seconds to load as only 15.86% of sites in the top 20 results from this sample were slower than this. Using the site speed equation described earlier, if your site takes 19.45 seconds to load, you are only faster than 0.3% of the web.</div><div>&nbsp;</div> <div><h2>How to Improve&nbsp;Your Site Speed</h2></div> <div>If you want to improve your SEO, I would suggest <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/what-are-your-best-tips-for-link-builders">building</a> <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-to-get-your-community-to-build-links-for-you">a</a> <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/investing-in-link-building">link</a> instead of focusing on speed (unless your site is currently extremely slow). That said, speed is a metric you should be trying to improve in order to improve the overall user experience. To decrease your load time, there are a few best practices you should follow:</div> <ul>     <li>Minimize HTTP Requests - Your pages will load faster if they have to wait for fewer HTTP requests. This means reducing the number of items that need to be loaded, such as scripts, style sheets, and images.</li>     <li>Combine all of your CSS into an external file and link to it from the &lt;head&gt; section each page instead of loading it in the HTML of a page. This allows the external page to be cached so that it loads faster. JavaScript should be handled in a similar fashion as CSS.</li>     <li>Use <a href="http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/">CSS</a> <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/27/the-mystery-of-css-sprites-techniques-tools-and-tutorials/">sprites</a> whenever possible - This combines images used in the background into one image and reduces the number of HTTP requests made.</li>     <li>Make sure your images are optimized for the web - If you have Photoshop, this can be done by simply clicking &ldquo;save for web&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;save&rdquo;. By optimizing the formats of the images you are essentially formatting the images in a smarter way so that you end up with a smaller file size. Smashing Magazine has a nice article on <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/15/clever-png-optimization-techniques/">optimizing png images</a>.</li>     <li>Use server side caching - This creates a html page for a URL so that dynamic sites don't have to build a page each time that URL&nbsp;is requested.</li><li>Use Gzip - <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-optimize-your-site-with-gzip-compression/">Gzip</a> will significantly compress the size of the page sent to the browser which then uncompresses the information and displays it for the user. Many sites who use Gzip are able to reduce the file size by upwards of 70%. You can see if sites are using Gzip and how much the page has been compressed by using <a href="http://www.gidnetwork.com/tools/gzip-test.php">GID&nbsp;Zip Test</a>.</li><li>Use a Content Delivery Network - Using a CDN allow your users to download information in parallel, helping your site to load faster. CDNs are becoming increasingly affordable with services like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a>.</li>          <li>Reduce 301 Redirects - Don&rsquo;t use 301 redirects if possible; definitely don&rsquo;t stack 301&rsquo;s on top of each other. 301 redirects force the browser to a new URL and require the browser to wait for the HTTP request to come back.</li> </ul> <p>If you want to do further research on improving your site speed, Google has a good list of helpful articles for optimizing your page speed <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/articles/">here</a> that are much more in-depth than the above suggestions.

The article was entitled, &quot;Google: Bing Is Cheating, Copying Our Search Results,&quot; and as you can imagine, there was a lot of response from the SEO community. After the flames cooled down and the information in the article was discussed further, SELand wrote up <a href="http://searchengineland.com/bing-why-googles-wrong-in-its-accusations-63279">a counter piece</a>, &quot;Bing: Why Google&rsquo;s Wrong In Its Accusations,&quot; entailing a walk-through of what exactly Bing was doing and why it's not &quot;copying&quot; per se but instead mere consideration of a valuable search signal.</p> <p>This week on Whiteboard Friday, Rand talks to the Director of Bing, Stefan Weitz, and discusses some of the implications of using clickstream data in Bing's search algorithm. As Stefan discusses, Bing is trying to take a more holistic approach to search results calculation and delivery to ensure searchers get the information most relevant to them, which means using a variety of data sources and experimenting with innovative ways to display results to users. He also gives us some insight into the future of Bing Webmaster Tools.

<p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Video Transcription</h2> <blockquote>Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Howdy, SEOmoz fans. Welcome to another edition of Whiteboard Friday. This week we have a very special guest with us, Stefan Weitz, director of Bing.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How are you doing? <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stefan, thank you so much for joining us.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sure.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Really appreciate it.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It's on the way home. It's actually better for me this way.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, Stefan has two great distinctions. Number one, you were recently honored best hair at Bing. Is that right?<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That was actually true and it was by mistake. One day I woke up and I had long hair and then I was afraid of getting scissors near my head and so I won't cut it now.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's phenomenal. And second, you are tasked with dealing with messy cleanup from incorrect PR that happens on the Internet and in major media sources.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes PR that I actually create. It's like job security over and over again. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's great. Well, let's see if we can't create some job security for you here today on Whiteboard Friday.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm sure we can. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So we are going to get into some of the clickstream topics, but the first thing I actually wanted to chat about is something that you and I were talking about before this session. I think it will be of big interest to a lot of webmasters. So Bing obviously is gaining some nice market share, having a significant impact. Clearly Google is thinking you guys are more and more of a threat, which has got to feel a little flattering. It's got to be a nice feeling. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, I mean certainly it's good to know that. I mean, no one's really gained share against Google since Google launched. And look, they do a phenomenal job and they have for years and they've served us well for over a decade. So, yeah, it's nice to see us actually, between us and our Yahoo-powered search or the search that we power for Yahoo as well, I mean, you're talking between 26 and 30 percent of queries are now served by a Bing engine, which is great. The engineers love to see their work being used. There's nothing worse as engineers, as we all know, than writing something that never gets used. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh boy. I can tell you some frustrations we've had on that front. Now, in terms of Bing and Google, one of the things that is really interesting is this New York Times story that came out this past weekend around JCPenney. So a search consultant was using Open Site Explorer, digging through the backlinks . . .<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nice plug.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, it was a nice plug. Oh yeah, I have to plug SEOmoz on Whiteboard Friday. That's very important. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Okay. Make sure we're clear on that.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So they're digging through these backlinks and they're finding a lot of what look like manipulative and paid links that apparently an agency that JCPenney had hired to do some search marketing work for them had purchased to help inflate their ranks. And for a year plus, or nine months plus, they'd been ranking number one, number two, number three at Google and fairly well, reasonably well on Bing, for most of this time for a lot of big searches. So one of the big ones we talked about was &quot;dresses&quot; and &quot;bedding&quot; and these kinds of generic terms. So the New York Times writes this article. That afternoon, Google sort of responds and says, &quot;Hey, we're taking some punitive action against them.&quot; In the article they talked about this.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A penalty basically, yeah. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, we did a search right before this Whiteboard started, and we searched for &quot;JCPenney dresses.&quot;<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's right.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And JCPenney is not in the top three results. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's where it got weird for me, actually. I mean, look, I get . . . there are certainly, it's well within Google's rights to say, hey, we want to manually penalize a domain for any number of reasons. That happens. We generally don't like to use a lot of manual re-ranking. We like to try it algorithmically if we can because that just seems like it's actually a more scalable fashion. But you're right. What's happening here, I think, is they've kind of gone a little too far down the path of penalization. Because literally as we looked at, &quot;JCPenney dresses,&quot; probably the best P1 result would be JCPenney's dress site, I would think. Right?<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And now it doesn't appear anywhere on that P1, page 1.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And in fact, I think the fourth result is like their mobile page, which is sort of a weird result to have in the web search. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And this is happening because of this penalization system. One of the things that is really curious, I think, for a lot of webmasters, how are Bing and Google ever going to beat this problem on a macro scale?<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's an excellent question. So, there's a couple ways. There is the kind of short-term thing we're looking at from the ranker itself. Like, are there particular classes of link farms that we know are of low quality? Can we kind of apply some kind of discount to links that are coming in from what appear to be low-quality link farms? There's stuff we can do there, which we'll do too. We'll all look at these methods to figure out . . .<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There's a lot of machine learning that goes into that process, to say like here's a big set of what we think are spam links.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So as a webmaster, you better not look like spam, either the spam that exists today or the spam that's going to exist tomorrow because a classifier is going to catch that.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's right. And this is a machine, right? And so you could get ostensibly swept up into one of these categories, right? We actually had someone mail us, a couple weeks ago, who had a site that actually looked like it may have been a spam site. It actually wasn't, but it had a lot of characteristics of what we consider them to be and so she was getting a penalty it looked like on her site. And so we said, &quot;Okay, we can't tell you exactly what to fix, obviously, but here's some things you ought to look at.&quot; So there are some things that are happening there.<br /><br />But, I think, if we go a little bit further, there are two things. We, Google, everyone, Yahoo, Bing, we all use human judges to kind of measure relevancy.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right. Google has this big worldwide distributed team of search quality raters, and you guys have a team as well.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Same thing. HRS, yeah, same thing, and so human raters actually look at this. The challenge we have, we were looking over the weekend, all the engineers, we were all in threads over the weekend looking at this problem and we said, gosh, you know the problem is for bedding, the JCPenney result wasn't bad to a human. Maybe it shouldn't have been P1, but P4? I don't know. Actually if you ask a human to say, &quot;Is this a good result?&quot; They go, &quot;Yeah, it's actually pretty good.&quot;<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So this is why you're not going to get spam quality raters who are saying, oh, JCPenney ranks first for bedding, complain and spam report.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exactly.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No. JCPenney seems perfectly reasonable. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's right. And so if we took it all the way out, we actually realize that you likely would decrease any CG or the kind of cumulative gain that we get as we measure relevance. So if you yank it out, you actually then, people go, &quot;Wait, where did JCPenney go? They sell bedding.&quot; And so it's one of those weird things actually to try to correct for when you have a situation like this. <br /><br />But in the longer term, this really points to the bigger challenge with search, which is stopping thinking of search as just a way to navigate the collection of links across the Web. Essentially, we've been doing the same kind of search now for over a decade, right? It's basically anchor text and page rank and inbound links, and that's how we've kind of decided what page is best for a particular term.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And you think that this model of anchor text, page rank, or in Bing's case static rank and diversity of incoming domains, that's going to fade out to something else? Or it's going to be bolstered by other things?<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah. I think that'll be around for a long time. So don't worry. You don't have to like go and sell off. Don't call up Rand and say, &quot;I want out.&quot; That's all fine. I don't know. I always think of you as . . .<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That I sell links? Really?<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No. You know orange is Bing's color. That's why I took the color. <br /><br />But there are signals beyond this. That'll be for a long time. But what we're looking at, and the example I was using today with some engineers was, you do a query &ndash; not to pimp Bing here &ndash; but if you do a query for, say, shoes on Bing, we actually . . . the first answer now, we actually fire off what's called a visual search gallery, which basically is a way to navigate 3,000 pairs of shoes using a more familiar visual metaphor. So you can say, &quot;Okay, I actually want high heels. I want patent leather. I want black.&quot; <br /><br />It's kind of like applying metadata to your query, and it actually rejiggers the results in real time based on what it is you're trying to do. Because in many cases, people do come to engines and they put in one word, they put in two words, very ambiguous. &quot;Shoes&quot; is a horrible query, right? But we get a lot of that. So the question really is do we just take &quot;shoes&quot; and just try to throw back everything we can against that word, which of course is going to be fraught with problems. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right. Shoes.com. Online shoes. Shoe store. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, exactly. Is that the right thing? Really, is something that ambiguous actually calling out for a more reasonable approach where we say, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Kind of like if you and I were talking and I would say, &quot;Shoes.&quot; And you go, &quot;What? What, like dress shoes? What are you asking? Do you want to buy shoes?&quot; So we have conversations. And today, engines, they kind of fail. They're very autonomic. They're kind of an in and out type transaction. And we think, with things like Visual Search, we're able to actually start to say, &quot;Okay, great. What do you really mean with that query,&quot; and try to pivot and help people refine. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So Google's got kind of on the left side those related searches or search suggestions. You guys have search suggestions. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the left and the top. On the top. We actually do an answer bar at the top. Those are interesting ways of conversation modes, but we're even looking at ways to go a little further than that without getting into Clippy, which I love Clippy, but not everyone loves Clippy. So something like that without being annoying. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I always worry that people are going to think Roger, our mozBot, is Clippy-like. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, you know what? Can we borrow him for our . . .<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You totally can. We have a current asking price. I'll let you know after this Whiteboard Friday.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So there's that. Longer term, we're looking at how we think of the Web really as a representation of the physical world itself. So we understand that, the weird example I was giving you earlier, &quot;Inception&quot; is a movie. You and I understand that &quot;Inception&quot; is a movie. We understand &quot;Inception&quot; as a movie has a certain number of characteristics. Movies have reviews. They have show times. They have previews. They have trailers. They have pictures. They have conversations on Twitter.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So are you saying, from a marketer's standpoint, let me imagine that this is the knowledge that I've got about &quot;Inception.&quot; It's a movie. Do I then want to say, &quot;Oh, I should make sure that a page about 'Inception' of mine has things like information about who is acting in it and maybe a video of the preview or the trailer and reviews and data like that and that it's in the movie realm rather than just being the page on the Internet with the most inbound links that say 'Inception.'&quot; <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, because honestly, what's going to happen is . . . we just did this, actually, with our last release. We have become much smarter about these objects on the Web. So we do actually know &quot;Inception,&quot; and that's a weird example. Think of like, &quot;Casablanca,&quot; which actually has multiple editions that have been re-released over the years and there are different release dates. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And there's an actual city.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exactly, right that too. But now we can begin to say, okay, this &quot;Casablanca&quot; on Netflix is the same &quot;Casablanca&quot; you can buy on Amazon or you can rent on iTunes. That's actually a lot harder than you think because the movie domain is not as clear.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So this is like an entity association type of algorithm. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, exactly. And so that's what we're going to see more and more search heading towards, we believe, is that us understanding the Web again literally as a representation of the world and not just a bunch of links and pages and static text. That offers up an entirely new way to think about ranking. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess that would be my last question on this before we move on to the clickstream stuff is, as a marketer, what should I be thinking about to be a step ahead as this is coming forward? It sounds like there's naturally going to be some brands who are doing these types of things already. I'm a small website. I'm starting out. I review movies. I want to make sure that Bing and Google know that my stuff is good. What should I be thinking about?<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Today, all the classification is done in a very machine learned process. Ideally, there are defined microformats you have for a lot of these things. I can see a lot of that coming down the road. Even like Facebook's Open Graph system has a limited amount of RDF.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right. I can say, &quot;This is me. Rel=me.&quot; <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Or you can say something like, I forget the actual phrasing, but basically you can say, &quot;This page is about a movie,&quot; for example. I would be watching very carefully what standards or even what proposed standards begin to evolve to help describe things that you're working on in a more concrete manner. So if you are selling, let's say your business is selling sheet music of 1930s swing songs, as an example. There will be a time in the not too distant future, in most people's opinion actually, not just mine anymore, where you're able to actually mark up this piece of sheet music that I'm selling. There will be kind of an ontology or some kind of taxonomy which lets the marketers say, this is from, I can't think of composers from the 30s, but some composer &ndash; composer=foo, decade=foo, year=foo &ndash; and actually begin to describe this thing, this object as an object and not as simply a web page, hoping that we crawl and parse it correctly. Because, frankly, crawling and parsing is a very messy, expensive, and inaccurate science. <br /><br />That's the brave new world. But again, for now, just keep doing great SEO work, but don't buy links. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Don't buy links. Let's move into another really interesting story around this clickstream stuff. So a couple weeks ago . . . no, I'm sorry. I guess it was about a month and a half ago. So Google built a little honeypot, right? Essentially they say, we think that . . . well, because Google and Bing are both using these signals of clickstream data, Google says we think we can engineer this clever system to catch Bing by using a nonsense word.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And essentially what they caught you guys doing is not building a system that was robust enough to recognize, oh, when we have very few signals about some random nonsense word, maybe we should be tossing those out because otherwise we could be manipulated in a way that would make us look bad.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right. Yeah, let's do it.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So let's go with an analogy here. This is a terrible representation of the island of Manhattan, right?<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wow. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So here's maybe here's Central Park. Does that sound . . .<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's better. Now I . . .<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now you're there. Washington Heights right here. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My mom grew up in Harlem right over there. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My sister lived right here for a while. This is kind of fun. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, navigating the island of Manhattan are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of vehicles. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe even a million vehicles. I'm not exactly sure. There's like 11 million people in the city. So if I get a Bing navigation system, Bing is going to tell me based on traffic patterns and the weather and the time of day which way I should go in New York City. Hang with me, this analogy works.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It does work, I think.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So Bing has this nice satellite that's orbiting up here.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is hypothetical, by the way. There is no Bing satellite watching traffic. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right. This is a pure analogy.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone is going to be freaking out.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So there's a satellite that's sort of watching and saying, &quot;Oh here, look at traffic patterns.&quot; And Google's got their nice satellite. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah. They actually do have one though, watching everything you do. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's good to know.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm sorry. Was that out loud? <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh boy, you're going to get into big trouble. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There goes that sponsorship.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So they're both watching all the traffic patterns and what they see is, oh, you know what? The best traffic pattern at 4:00 p.m. on a Tuesday for a midsize car is to go down the West Side. The East Side is just a mess. Park Avenue, nobody wants to be there, but the West Side, that looks quite good. So they're directing cars this way. <br /><br />Now, what Google did in this instance, taking this analogy to search is essentially say, &quot;Oh, you know what? It's 2:00 a.m. on Christmas Eve. There's virtually nobody on the road and we're actually going to grab . . . you know what? We're going to make this weird, new three-wheeled blue vehicle that no one has ever seen before and we're going to send them this weird circuitous route. In fact, they're going to have to cross over Central Park and around there.&quot; Oh my gosh, just to get down to Wall Street. <br /><br />And so Bing is monitoring this and they see, all right, well there's one blue car traveling on Christmas Eve at 2:00 a.m. This is the route it takes. And then next Christmas Eve, when a blue car shows up, some Google engineer goes home and gets into his blue car and checks, &quot;Oh look, that's the route that Bing is sending me. They must be . . .&quot; What do they call it? <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Copying. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right, cheating off my test. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, copying, cheating.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It doesn't seem like an entirely accurate analogy, but it's pretty good. Well, the cheating off the test results seems . . . it seems like the kind of way that things are going. So Google and Bing are both looking at where people are going on the Web, what they're clicking on, when they search for something, what do they get to next, what do they seem to be happy with, did they refine those search queries and do other types of searches, can we learn based on that behavior? Seems like a very smart way to go. And you saw, there was an ex-Google engineer who went on Quora and said, &quot;Oh yeah, when I worked at Google, we did exactly the same thing.&quot; <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, yeah. That's kind of what I was so perplexed about is that it's not . . . (a) we've said we've been doing this for years. We've actually, since '07, been doing clickstream analysis. It's an opt-in thing. Again, it's anonymous. People opt-in to it. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the Google engineers who checked this, they went home and they installed Internet Explorer with the toolbar and opted in.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And opted in, correct.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So that they would show you guys this data. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exactly. And so what? We made no secret of this at all. This is actually, we think, a very valuable signal to have. Now, that being said, I can tell you, without getting into all the details, it's not a huge signal. It's one of thousands of signals we use to actually calculate PR.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I bought thousands of Mechanical Turkers and had them all click your results for SEO, and I didn't move one position. So I'm really upset about that. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aw, dammit. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Because based on what I saw here I thought . . .<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You thought you could nail them, right?<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought I could just get it. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So that's the first thing is that we, and Google even themselves uses this data. They are kind of going back and forth if they do or not. But look, we know for deep links, likely they use toolbar plus . . .<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right, sure. Yeah. If I click that JCPenney search result, there's these other links that pop up there, and they're usually the same ones that people search for most often and click on most often.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exactly.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's a good customer experience. You actually want to encourage that. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, totally.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They have, I think, they've got a site speed ranking factor as well. How fast is the site? And they'll show you that data in Webmaster Tools and that comes from the toolbar. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's right. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I think they say it comes from the toolbar inside Webmaster.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, well, there you go. I'm not throwing mud at all. I think it's actually a very valuable thing. What was frustrating to me, I think, is just the fact that it was . . . they successfully proved something we've said we've done now for three years, which is great. They've given me a proof.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, to be fair, you guys probably should have written something that said, hey, if someone builds a honeypot and uses these small signals . . . so they've got a little gotcha.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Absolutely.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But I think maybe it was the press who blew it into a pretty big gotcha.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah. At the end, it's really, you're right. And we actually were talking to Harry, who kind of runs all engineering for Bing and he's like, &quot;If anything, they helped us kind of find a bug. Maybe we should be throwing out if we only have one signal.&quot; Because really, the reason that 7 of the 100 that actually tried the beta with . . . so we actually didn't fire. They gave 100 terms and 93 we didn't actually do anything.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So they had 100 blue cars.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's right.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You only tracked a few of them.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We tracked all of them because they have clickstream, of course, but we just didn't use the clickstream in our ranker. I would have to look at the probe. Something triggered something somewhere and said, &quot;Even though we have this signal from toolbar, something doesn't feel right. We're not going to fire anything at all.&quot; So seven of the hundred actually did, and that was, probably where we had . . . maybe the engineers got a little happy at home and they had a couple gin and tonics and started clicking like crazy on the link and that gave us more data than the other terms. Who knows. But the point is that we think it's a valuable thing to use. We think the behaviors of customers on the Web who have said they want to help improve the product through their usage, we think it's the customer's behavior that they're giving to us to use and refine. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, this would be like in the SEOmoz web app, for example, us saying, &quot;Oh, you know what? When people go from their on page to their ranking report, lots of people are doing that, let's put those tabs right next to each other.&quot; <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exactly.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let's do it. It seem pretty natural.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the arguments that I had heard from people on the Web was, &quot;You just shouldn't be using it. It's just not your data.&quot; And I think that the Web was built on this notion of collective intelligence. And frankly, Google has a lot of search data. We know this, right? So to ignore it just because it comes from a competitor, it seems . . .<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, you're not just doing this on Google, right? You do it on Yahoo.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, yeah. The clickstream, right.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If somebody searches SEOmoz's website, you'll see that if I use Internet Explorer.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So it doesn't matter the specific source. Right?<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the big brouhaha. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So let me ask, from a marketer's perspective. I think a lot of people in search observed this behavior and then said to themselves, &quot;Wait a minute. I can drive blue cars. Can I influence things through the clickstream?&quot; Is that something where you've already seen an uptick in manipulation? <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There have been attempts, I'm sure. But the reason this was so successful, if you call 7 out 100 successful, was because they were nonsense words, words that no one would ever use.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Literally zero search volume ever. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Precisely. They were made up words. And then Google did a manual re-rank of those in their index. So when you searched for them on Google, this one site would pop up. It was a completely . . . and even that, even with that explicit signal, only 7 out of 100 actually worked. So I would tell you that it probably isn't a good use of your time to be doing a lot of clicking on clickstreams to try to rank higher.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gotcha. All right. Well, good to know. We'll try something else. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exactly. But what it does say is that if you rank organically high generally . . . do what you generally do to rank high organically, because that is a factor. In other words, if you do rank at P2 on Google or P2 on Bing and people are clicking through, they search for SEOmoz and click on that link. It's just good practice. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So you're saying one of the things that SEOs maybe need to be thinking a little bit more about is not just getting that position, but making sure that once you have that position, people want to click on it.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you maximizing? That's right. Your caption, your title, all this stuff.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right, that title and that meta description.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exactly. Make sure . . . you want that click after they search for you if it is the right site for that particular term. So yeah, that was &quot;Copygate&quot; a couple weeks ago. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, I'm glad we're done with that.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was fun. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, I'm sure you want to do that all the time.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One hair is grey now because of that. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have more than that. So, third question, and last question, but I think a lot of people are interested. What's some new stuff that's coming out at Bing? Either for searchers or for webmasters, because I know Webmaster Tools has sort of been in a little bit of a stagnant state for a little while.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It's catch-up, I'd say. We just actually brought in Duane Forrester who you guys might know out in the community.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, absolutely.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Duane now works on the Bing team, and he is in charge of a lot of stuff. He'll be out there in the forums with you guys a lot more and across the entire ecosystem for Bing. Duane will be our guy out there in the space. We updated the Webmaster Tools, I think it was a couple months ago now. It's all Silverlight-based. There's still some areas I know we need to catch up in. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I won't give you too hard a time, but the Silverlight . . .<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I know.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When you install Silverlight functionality, there are a few things you lose that you have on the HTML side.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, that's frustrating. But the good news is that we've staffed a team of actually more than we had before. So those guys are cranking on the new functionalities. We know that we have to do a better job there. We know it. No one's hiding like, &quot;No, we're hot. Let's just keep going.&quot; We think we do a good job. We can do a lot better.<br /><br />And then as far as new stuff for consumers is concerned, I think one of the most interesting things that we'll have rolled out this week &ndash; since this is Friday, I can talk about it now &ndash; is this new thing called tiles. You'll see them on the page. Think of it now as really a user experience enhancement. In essence, what we found was that people are able, when they see basically a page, if you look at the page and you do a query for something like, I don't know, let's just do one. What's that new Natalie Portman film? <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, that looks terrible. Not &quot;Black Swan.&quot;<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Not &quot;Black Swan,&quot; the other one. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, with Ashton Kutcher. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So we'll let's call it &quot;new Natalie Portman film.&quot; I don't what it's called, but whatever it's called.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's probably a good search. Since we can't remember, lots of people are querying that. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That's probably true. I can see the billboard in my head, but I can't . . .6<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I can see the preview. Clearly bad branding.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;God, no kidding. What the hell? Anyway, so you do a search for this on Bing and you get all the results here, all of the organic results. And what you're seeing now with the introduction of tiles is a little visual indicator here on the side for a couple of these results that come from what we call authoritative sites. So you might have one from IMDB here, one from Rotten Tomatoes, one from, I don't know, Flixster, etc. We're actually going to be pulling in metadata from those sites. So you have the average 77% fresh rating here. Flixster might have their rating, IMDB can have their rating. But what we're doing now is we 're actually . . . because we know people actually are able to figure out the results they're looking for if you append some kind of visual cue onto the page. So by adding on these visual cues for these kind of authoritative sites or high-quality sites. . .<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are they sending data specifically to you, or are you guys pulling that from their page without them even having to do anything? <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No. In this case, there's been some agreement with these guys. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So it's like when Google was testing some of their rich snippets, what they call recipes and yeah, yeah, yeah.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So that I think . . . we'll see. It's just a test now, but we'll see how it works. Internal flighting have been pretty successful with it, and it really provides a way for people to actually find what they're looking for much faster, because you know the logo for IMDB, you know the logo for Flixster, maybe. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And if I think I'm a trusted website, hopefully in a few months I'll be able to submit something to you, give you some data, and you could potentially give me this kind of result. <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah. Nothing to announce yet, but you're getting the idea. Exactly. This notion of how do you kind of ingest third party content more successfully and make it more discoverable to people. So that's kind of fun. <br /><br />And then, of course, a lot of mobile stuff has come out in the past couple months. You'll see more of this going forward. But really focusing on the scenarios as you're on the go. You know, unfortunately, it's not out yet, so I can't talk about it. Just let me think for a second. It's so awesome. You're going to love it. Just wait. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it on all Nokia devices now? <br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It should be. We'll do a follow up. Next time, I'll actually bring a machine and we can actually demo stuff.<br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, that sounds awesome. I love it. Well, Stefan, this has been phenomenal stuff. I think people really appreciate you and Duane particularly being out in the community talking to webmasters about this type of stuff. I hope you'll join us maybe in the comments if folks have a couple questions.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Absolutely. Just don't make fun of my hair. That's all I ask. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was windy outside before he got up here.<br /><br />Stefan:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sure. <br /><br />Rand:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks so much for joining us. Thanks, everyone. Take care. We'll see you again next week for another edition of Whiteboard Friday. <br /><br /></blockquote> <p>Video transcription by <a href="http://www.speechpad.com/">SpeechPad.com</a></p><br /><p>Do you like this post? <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/12024/1/0">Yes</a> <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/12024/0/0">No</a> </p><div class="feedflare">

A bad day at the office can inspire daydreams of earning more money and working from home in your pajamas. There are clear advantages to becoming your own boss but the grass isn't always greener, as they say.</p> <p>Remember the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/seo-industry-survey">2010 SEO Industry Survey</a>? More than 10,000 respondents participated and the result was some fascinating analysis by <a href="http://www.distilled.co.uk/company/people/will-critchlow.html">Will Critchlow</a> and the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/img/survey/2010-seo-industry-survey-seomoz-v1.jpg">Anatomy of a Search Marketer</a> infographic was born. I was in love. As I began exploring the anatomy of an Independent Search Marketer the raw data from this earlier survey revealed yet another use.</p> <p>I'll share a few new findings from the survey that I thought would be most interesting to those thinking of going solo. Also, as someone who's experienced in-house, agency, and now independent search marketing roles perhaps I can have a useful perspective. I'll try my hardest, anyway!</p> <p>Lets check out the data first. After I shatter your dreams of making more money and attending every search marketing event once you go independent, we'll dive in to what the job of an Independent Search Marketer really looks like. If you are still interested, that is.</p> <p>As with any survey, there  are a number of caveats to take into consideration when looking at the data and  conclusions. Take a read of those cautions as described when we first released the survey data <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/seo-industry-survey">over here</a>. All of the data below looks only at US based respondents. There were 846 US Based Agency Search Marketers, 2217 US Based In-House Search Marketers, and and 1176 US Based Independent Consultants.</p> <h2>Interesting Find #1</h2> <p>On average, Independent Consultants earn about the same as Agency Search Marketers and In-House Search Marketers. The average yearly earnings for all three groups was within the $60-$75K range. As you can see in the graph below however, the distribution is very different. I'll let you interpret that bit as you will.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="600" height="356" align="middle" alt="earnings comparison" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/earnings.jpg" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">If you're thinking of going independent for the financial advantage, rub the dollar signs from your eyes and think seriously about your business plan and revenue forecast. More money isn't a given, but is of course possible.</p> <h2>Interesting Find #2</h2> <p>Independent Consultants work with a smaller book of clients at one time than Agency Search Marketers.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="600" height="321" alt="how many clients do you work with at one time?" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/how-many-clients-at-once(1).jpg" /></p> <p>If you're looking for variety and to work with a larger number of clients at once, an Agency job might be your best bet. If you prefer to dive deep with a handful of clients, an Independent Consultant career path could be the way to go. Personally, I'd call this finding a big plus for the Independent Consultant side.</p> <h2>Interesting Find #3:</h2> <p>Independent Consultants are less likely to attend industry events and conferences than both Agency Search Marketers and In-House Search Marketers.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="600" height="368" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/attended-event(1).jpg" alt="attended-event" /></p> <p>Uh oh. Come on Independents! If I&nbsp;were to guess, I'd say that Independent Consultants are less likely to attend industry events because the cost comes directly out of their own pockets. I'm interested in your thought on this, too.</p> <h2>What does it take to become an Independent Search Marketer?</h2> <p>Still thinking of taking the leap from employed to self-employed? Lets explore how your duties as an In-House or Agency Search Marketer might change in your new role as Entrepreneur and Lone Ranger.</p> <p><strong>Expert Skills</strong></p> <p>Regardless of what search segment you choose to focus on, as an Independent Consultant your clients will expect you to be an expert. They'll be hiring you to make solid recommendations usually beyond the skill set that they have in-house. It is okay to ask for help from your peers (read your consultant/client NDA first!) and seek the opinions of others, but YOU need to make the call on the final recommendation based on your experience, expertise, and the information at hand.</p> <p><strong>Stay S-M-R-T Skills</strong></p> <p>In The Simpsons' &quot;Homer Goes to College&quot; episode, Homer gleefully sets his high school diploma  aflame, while singing, &quot;I am so smart, I am so smart, S-M-R-T, I mean  S-M-A-R-T!&quot; Behind him his living room is going up in flames (<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=S-M-R-T">quote</a>). Just because you've made it into the realm of independent consulting doesn't mean you can stop going to conferences (see Interesting Find #3). Keep engaging, keep reading, and keep learning if you wish to continue growing your career.</p> <p><strong>Self-Promotion Skills</strong></p> <p>Don't like to toot your own horn? That'll cost ya. You need to be able to speak intelligently and convincingly about your subject matter. You need to speak confidently about your experience and skills without taking it too far.</p> <p><strong>Nun-chuck Skills</strong></p> <p><img width="75" height="50" align="left" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/nunchuck-skills.jpg" alt="nun-chuck skills" />Just kidding. You don't need nun-chuck skills to be an Independent Consultant, unless your also trying to get girls. Right Napoleon?</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Closing-the-Deal Skills</strong></p> <p>Do you have a hard time asking for things? Once you've covered the Expert and Self-Promotion pieces, you might find yourself in a position to sell something. So, what do you do?</p> <p>As an in-house or agency consultant, you likely haven't had to sell  your services... for money. Sure, you sell ideas, projects, and the  like. You may even be great at asking for a raise or negotiating for  more holiday time. What it comes down to is this. Are you willing to  look a prospect in the eye (or at least speak over the phone) and sell a  project along with the price tag?</p> <p><strong>General Business Skills</strong></p> <p>You might be an SEO prodigy, but that doesn't mean you are a business  person. It is possible that the most brilliant SEO on the planet would  be most successful and earn the most money if he is allowed to focus on  his core strength. Running an independent SEO consulting business  requires a lot of tasks that will take you away from the thing you love.  Here is a quick list of the non-SEO stuff you&rsquo;ll need to be prepared to  tackle.</p> <ul>     <li><b>Marketing</b> &ndash; I know, you can show up in the SERPs for the  terms you are targeting but SEO isn&rsquo;t the only marketing channel at your  disposal to drum up clients. What else do you have in your tool belt?  Email, graphic design, advertising, social media, affiliate...? Take  stock and make sure you have enough tricks <img width="200" height="347" align="right" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/bill-collecting.jpg" alt="bill collecting" />up your sleeve.</li>     <li><b>Basic Accounting</b> &ndash; Even if you hire an outside accountant  to handle your taxes, you&rsquo;re going to have to keep records and have a  clue about balancing a budget, filling out a W-9, invoicing, accounts  payable, etc.<b><br />     </b></li>     <li><b>Bill Collecting -</b> If a client doesn't pay, it is on you to follow-up and make it happen. Outsourcing this function can be pretty expensive, so be prepared to do it yourself at least in the beginning.</li>     <li><b>Strategic Planning </b>&ndash; Sorry, this one sounds borrowed from  a business 101 text book. The content there wasn't all drivel!  Strategic planning is important because you need to be able to plan and  think about your business as well as do the work.<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></li>     <li><b>Old-Fashioned Paper Pushing </b>&ndash; You&rsquo;ll need to register  your business and keep it registered, notice and do something about  legal matters as they arise, open your mail, deal with banks, order  business cards, etc. This is my least favorite part about being  independent. Each of these items can seem like a small task, but add them  up and you can lose a lot of valuable billable time.</li> </ul> <p><strong>People Skills</strong></p> <p>You may know your search marketing inside and out. You may have a solution identified to triple a web property's search traffic. Unfortunately none of that will matter if you can't communicate and influence your prospects and clients. Some people are excellent at this from birth. Others have to work at it.</p> <div><b>Money or Mommy</b></div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>If you aren&rsquo;t lucky enough to have contracts set-to-go the day you  transition from employee to independent, you&rsquo;ll last a lot longer if you  have a cushion while you get on your feet. You can be creative here,  for sure, because a safety net can take on many forms. Here are a few ideas.</div> <ul>     <li><b>Save money first </b>( You're so smart!)</li>     <li><b>Move back in with Mom.</b> Food, shelter, bedtime stories, what more do you need? (Think I'm kidding? See: <a href="http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/pdf/09-16-10_slides.pdf">Census Bureau data</a>, Slide 18)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>     <li><b>Take a loan.</b> This seems like a bad idea, but your finances are your own business. :)</li>     <li><b>Lean on your partner. </b>Are you currently living large with two household incomes? I bet you could manage on one for a little while.</li>     <li><b>Get your boss to hire you. </b>Some of my best independent  consulting clients today are my employers of yesterday. Why not continue  to work a bit for your current boss, as an outside consultant? It could  make the transition smoother and help everybody meet their goals.</li> </ul> <h2>What is the fun in that?</h2> <p>Certainly there are a lot of heavy things to think about before making a go of it on your own. Lets round this post out with the top 5 reasons that being an Independent Consultant is awesome.</p> <ol>     <li>You can choose your own clients. Not into paper products? Don't pitch the project!</li>     <li>You don't have to get dressed in the morning. You should. The point is you don't have to.</li>     <li>You'll have a nice short commute from your bedroom to your office.</li>     <li>If you have a young family, you can oversee your children's care with in-home childcare.</li>     <li>If you do your best work at midnight, have at it. Aside from client calls and general daytime availability you can usually set your own hours.</li> </ol> <p>That does it for tonight. Happy Daydreaming!</p> <p>P.S.

You've been warned.  Please keep reading to see the awesomeness that is your new profile. *happy dance* :)</em></p> <p>Before  I jump into the new profiles and what's so great about them.  Let's take  a look back, a look at the profiles of yesteryear. Back in  the day when  the profile functionality was created, Twitter didn't even  exist yet (I  know... WHAT?! There was a life before Twitter?). The profiles were quite simple really, you could only post one link and design wise there was a ton of whitespace.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Old Profile Layout</em><br /><img width="620" height="659" alt="Old Profiles" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/old-profile.png" /></p><p style="text-align: left;">It is definitely time for an upgrade! So, let's take a look at some of the changes to the profiles.</p><h2>Lookin' Good</h2> <p>With this redesign you have the  ability to show us a lot more information about yourself! You have all  the same functionaity you had before, but with a ton of additions. For  example, you no longer have to add your Twitter name to the &quot;additional  contact info&quot; section, there's actually a place to add you Twitter name!  So let's take a look at a few screenshots with some of the changes.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>New Profile Layout</em><br /><img width="620" height="395" alt="Screenshot of a Public Profile" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/screenshot-public-profile2.png" /></p> <h2>More Links +&nbsp;Social Profiles</h2> <p>Not only do we show your community stats but you can see here we have  direct links to your social profiles and the ability to add more links! (although only one will have the nofollow removed after 200 points).</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Community Stats +&nbsp;Social &amp; Other Links</em><br /><img width="273" height="488" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/stats-and-links.png" alt="Stats &amp; links" /></p> <h2>More Profile Information</h2> <p>Now you get more bang for your buck and can display more information  about yourself. Remember that you can earn up to 20 MozPoints for having  a fully complete profile.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Profile Information</em><br /><img width="620" height="362" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/profile-info.png" alt="Profile Info" /></p> <h2>Comments and Blog Posts</h2> <p>Yea! This is information you had before, but now it's in a much  cleaner, prettier format. Plus you get more options to see the post  someone commented on and who wrote it. This will make it much easier to  navigate around. Below is a screenshot of <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/users/profile/104603">Casey Henry's</a> latest comments.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Comments &amp; Blog Posts </em><br /><img width="620" height="433" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/comments.png" alt="Comments on new profiles" /></p> <h2>Earn MozPoints</h2> <p>Yes,  that's right. You can earn MozPoints just for filling out your profile.  As you update your profile you'll notice that you points just for  filling in simple things like your name, title and bio. Take a look at  the screenshot below to see how MozPoints will be added.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="620" height="441" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/screenshot-mozpoints.png" alt="Screenshot of Earning MozPoints" /></p> <h2>MozPoint Changes</h2> <p>Along with the changes to the profile and the upcoming <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/state-of-the-community#proqa">changes to PRO Q&amp;A</a>  it made sense to take a look at how MozPoints are calculated, why users  would want to gain more and the ways to do that. Take a look at the new  <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/dp/mozpoints">MozPoints</a> page for all the details.</p> <p><strong>Ways to gain points</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>YOUmoz</strong>  - You'll now get 20 points when you get a YOUmoz post published (it  used to be 10). Plus if the post makes it to the main blog, you'll get  an ADDITIONAL 30 points. Which would give you a total of 50 points just  for the post, plus still continue to earn points for every thumbs up and  comment received on the post.</li><li><strong>Filling out your profile</strong> - More on that above. :)</li><li><strong>Comments</strong> - You continue to earn 1 MozPoint for each comment you write and 1 Mozpoint for every thumb up on your comment.</li><li><strong>New PRO Q&amp;A</strong>  - Right now this is in beta and only 100 users have access, but in the  coming months all PRO members will be able to use this forum to ask and  answer SEO questions. Free members, you can gain access by reaching over  500 MozPoints. Participating in PRO Q&amp;A is a great way to gain  points.</li></ul> <p><strong>Benefits of having MozPoints</strong></p> <p>Other than just looking cool, and being at the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/users">top of the list</a>, there really are benefits to earning MozPoints. A few of the highlights:</p> <ul><li>Earn 200+ MozPoints in one month and you'll be considered for one free month of PRO.</li><li>After  200 Mozpoints your first custom URL in your profile becomes followed.

This tale will mostly be told using graphics, as the images tell the story better than I can. Let's begin...</p>
<p>Last Monday while I was checking the morning tweets, I noticed a ton of tweets about our <a href="http://guides.seomoz.org/beginners-guide-to-search-engine-optimization">Beginner's Guide to SEO</a>. It didn't take long to realize that <a href="http://twitter.com/smashingmag">Smashing Magazine</a> had tweeted about it and the retweets were seriously rolling in. (And yes, they really did spell <em>Beginers</em> wrong ;).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Exhibit A - The Initial Tweet</em><br />
<img height="476" width="620" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/tweet-smashing-mag.png" alt="Smashing Magazine's Tweet about the beginner's guide" /></p>
<p>I quickly emailed the marketing team, with a &quot;Sweet! Smashing Magazine tweeted about the Beginner's Guide, let's watch for the traffic bump.&quot; Not long after Rand in his infinite wisdom realized that all of a sudden we were actually ranking on the first page for the term &quot;Beginner's Guide&quot; (without SEOmoz or SEO) and he tweeted.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Exhibit B - Rand's tweet as we realized we were ranking for general keyword</em><br />
<img height="536" width="599" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/tweet-rand-beginners-guide.png" alt="Rand's Tweet response" /></p>
<p>Whoa. Now, previously we weren't tracking that keyword as we hadn't really thought about trying to rank for such a general term (by the way, it is now a keyword we watch in our web app campaign). Most of the traffic to the Beginner's Guide usually comes from keywords like seo guide, seomoz beginners guide, what is seo, beginners guide seo, seo keyword research, etc. which are all directly related to SEO and the guide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rand had searched on &quot;Beginner's Guide&quot; about a month or two earlier and it wasn't anywhere in the SERPs, and we definitely weren't getting any traffic for that term. So we were obviously quite interested to see that now, after hundreds of retweets we were showing up on the first page for that term. HOLY&nbsp;WOWSERS. At that point I wasn't sure how long it was going to stick around so I took a screen shot, thinking &quot;this will make for a great case study.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Exhibit C - The SERP</em><br />
<img height="573" width="616" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/serp-beginners-guide.png" alt="Beginner's Guide in the SERPs" /></p>
<p>Sure this was really interesting but the question was &quot;will it last?&quot; or is this just an example of <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-query-deserves-freshness">QDF</a>? Over the next week I watched the ranking and traffic every day. The ranking seemed to fluctuate between the first and the second page for &quot;Beginner's Guide&quot; throughout the week. I even tweeted about it one day last week to see where others around the world were seeing our guide rank for the term. The response was overwhelming that most people in the U.S. saw it on the first page still (at various spots) and most international folks saw it on the second page (in the 11th-13th spots).</p>
<p>All pretty interesting but we all know ranking isn't everything right? So let's take a look at happened with our organic traffic for that keyword.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Exhibit D - The Traffic</em><br />
<img height="473" width="620" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/traffic-beginners-guide.png" alt="Traffic for Beginner's Guide" /></p>
<p>Sure, the traffic hasn't been huge, which is totally expected since our guide to SEO probably wasn't the user's intent if they searched for &quot;Beginner's Guide.&quot; Plus, the fact is, that's not a highly searched term, so getting a ton of traffic for it wouldn't make sense. What <em>IS</em> interesting though is that before the tweet, we had absolutely zero traffic for that keyword and after the tweet, we have traffic. It has obviously died down since the initial tweet but we're still getting traffic each day for it.</p>
<p>Just like our initial <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-do-tweets-influence-search-rankings-an-experiment-for-a-cause">test we ran a few months ago</a>, we'll continue to monitor the traffic and ranking for &quot;Beginner's Guide&quot; to see if the tweets only helped in the short term or in the long term as well. Until then, if you have any similar case studies or &quot;random awesome tweets that fall into your lap&quot; as we did, I'd love to hear about the outcome.</p>
<p>Oh, and one last little bit of info. Below is a screenshot of the data about the bit.ly URL that Smashing Magazine used in their tweet. It's pretty dang exciting to see how many clicks it generated!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img height="291" width="620" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/bitly-beginners-guide.png" alt="Bitly Data" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some takeaways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A high quantity of tweets from &quot;real&quot; users on Twitter has a pretty substantial impact on rankings in the short term (take note sources seeking rankings during high search volume periods - holidays, news events, etc.)</li>
    <li>It appears likely that Google (and Bing) are using the concept they described in <a href="http://searchengineland.com/what-social-signals-do-google-bing-really-count-55389">the interview on SELand</a> of &quot;Author Authority&quot; to help weight the value of tweets (as we've seen that bot-repeated tweeting in similar quantities doesn't have this affect)</li>
    <li>There seems to be some long-term, nascent value carried by tweets in addition to the short-term effects. If this is consistently observed, expect a lot more SEO activity around engaging and incenting tweeting to key URLs.</li>
    <li>It's still unknown whether and how much the text of a tweet impacts the SERPs in a way similar to anchor text. That will be an excellent next test for us to observe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ah... the power of tweets. :-)</p>

<p><strong>1996-1999:</strong> On-page keyword usage + meta data</p>
<p><strong>1999 - 2002: </strong>PageRank + On-page</p>
<p><strong>2002 - 2005:</strong> Anchor text + Domain name + PageRank + On-Page</p>
<p><strong>2005 - 2009: </strong>Domain authority + Diversity of linking domains + Topic modeling + Anchor text +&nbsp;Domain name + PageRank + On-Page</p>
<p>In 2010 and 2011, we've already seen <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/google-bing-confirm-twitter-facebook-influence-seo">the entry of social signals from Facebook and Twitter</a>. The <a href="http://searchengineland.com/bing-why-googles-wrong-in-its-accusations-63279">recent clickstream stories</a> revealed that both Google and Bing employ clickstream data (Bing has done so publicly for the last 3 years, Google more quietly and probably longer), though this likely is a relatively small data point for both.</p>
<p>It's my belief that the next generation of ranking signals will rely on three (relatively) new groups of metrics.</p>
<h2><strong>#1: Brand Signals</strong></h2>
<p>One of the reasons Google <a href="http://searchengineland.com/new-york-times-exposes-j-c-penney-link-scheme-that-causes-plummeting-rankings-in-google-64529">took so long to penalize JCPenney</a> (it was first spam reported to me in late 2009) is that their human raters and user data likely suggested it was actually quite a good result for searches like &quot;dresses&quot; and &quot;bedding.&quot; The brand name meant that people felt good about the listing and Google, up until the bad press, felt no need to take punitive action, if the methodology was manipulative (I'm pretty sure they knew about the manipulation for a long time, but wanted to solve it algorithmically).</p>
<p>For millions of retail, transactional-focused searches, Google's results are, to be honest, easily and often-gamed. We could find hundreds of examples in just a few hours, but the one below serves the purpose pretty well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img height="538" width="620" alt="Yellow Pumas Shoes Search" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/yellow-pumas-google-brand.gif" /></p>
<p>I just bought some new yellow pumas (<a href="http://www.shop.puma.com/Collections/PUMA-Picks/Campus-Kicks/Ducati-1198-ST-Shoes/pna885116700842,en_US,pd.html?cgid=23000">these ones</a>), but the best possible page Google could return (probably <a href="http://www.shop.puma.com/men/footwear/23000,en_US,sc.html?prefn1=mainColorId&amp;prefv1=I16">this one</a>) is nowhere to be found, and most of the first two pages of results aren't specific enough - a good number don't even offer any yellow Pumas that I could find!</p>
<p>Google wants to solve this, and one very good way is to separate the &quot;brands&quot; that produce happy searchers and customers from the &quot;generics&quot; - sites they've often classified as &quot;thin affiliates&quot; or &quot;poor user experiences.&quot; As webmasters and supporters of small-business on the web, we might complain, but as searchers, even we can agree that Puma, Amazon and Zappos would be pretty good results for a query like the above.</p>
<p>So what types of signals might Google employ to determine if a site is a &quot;brand&quot; or not?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Brand vs. Generic Signals" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/brand-vs-generic-signals.gif" /></p>
<p>These are just a few examples of data types and sources - Google/Bing can look at dozens, possibly hundreds of inputs (including applying machine learning to selected subsets of brand vs. non-brand sites to identify pattern matches that might not be instantly apparent to human algorithm creators).</p>
<p>As you might imagine, many manipulative sites could copy a number of these signals, but the engines can likely have a significant quality impact. <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-searchs-vince-change-google-says-not-brand-push-16803">The Vince update from 2009</a>&nbsp;is often pointed-to as a first effort along these lines from Google.</p>
<h2><strong>#2: Entity Associations</strong></h2>
<p>Search engines have, classically, relied on a relatively universal algorithm - one that rates pages based on the metrics available, without massive swings between verticals. In the past few years, however, savvy searchers and many SEOs have noted a distinct shift to a model where certain types of sites have a greater opportunity to perform for certain queries. The odds aren't necessarily stacked against outsiders, but the engines appear to bias to the types of content providers that are likely to fulfill the users' intent.</p>
<p>For example, when a user performs a search for &quot;lamb shanks,&quot; it could make a lot of sense to give an extra boost to sites whose content is focused on recipes and food.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Lamb Shanks Query with Entity Associations" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/lamb-shanks-bias.gif" /></p>
<p>This same logic could apply to &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=the+king's+speech">The King's Speech</a>&quot; where the engine might bias to film-focuses sites like RottenTomatoes, IMDB, Flixster or Metacritic.</p>
<p>Bill Slawski <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=4179">has written brilliantly</a> about entities in the past:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rather than just looking for brands, it&rsquo;s more likely that Google is trying to understand when a query includes an entity &ndash; a specific person, place, or thing, and if it can identify an entity, that identification can influence the search results that you see...</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">...I&rsquo;ve written about the topic before, when Google was granted a patent named&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=1408">Query rewriting with entity detection</a>&nbsp;back in May of 2009, which I covered in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=1408">Boosting Brands, Businesses, and Other Entities: How a Search Engine Might Assume a Query Implies a Site Search</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Google&rsquo;s recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=4032">acquistion of Metaweb</a>&nbsp;is noteworthy for a number of reasons. One of them is that Metaweb has developed an approach to cataloging different names for the same entity, so that for example, when Google sees names on the Web such as Terminator or Governator or Conan the Barbarian or Kindergarten Cop, it can easily associate those mentions with Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>Entity associations can be used to help bolster brand signals, classify query types (and types of results), and probably help with triggering vertical/universal results like Places/Maps, Images, Videos, etc.</p>
<h2><strong>#3: Human Quality Raters &amp; (Trusted) User Behavior</strong></h2>
<p>Last November, I wrote a post on my personal blog called &quot;<a href="http://randfishkin.com/blog/58/algorithm-crowd-not-enough">The Algorithm + the Crowd are Not Enough</a>&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the last decade, the online world has been ruled by two, twin forces: The Crowd and The Algorithm. The collective &ldquo;users&rdquo; of the Internet (The Crowd) create, click, and rate, while mathematical equations add scalability and findability to these overwhelming quantities of data (The Algorithm). Like the moon over the ocean, the pull of these two forces help create the tides of popularity (and obscurity) on the Internet. Information is more accessible, useful, and egalitarian than ever before.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">But lately, at least to me, the weaknesses of this crowdsourced + algorithmic system are showing, and the next revolution feels inevitable.</p>
<p>Given that Google's just launched a Chrome web extension to allow users to <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/new-chrome-extension-block-sites-from.html">block sites of their choosing in the SERPs</a> and the many attempts to leverage user data in the search results (remember <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-sidewiki-allows-anyone-to-comment-about-any-site-26420">SideWiki</a>, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-searchwiki-launches-15561">SearchWiki</a>, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-kills-searchwiki-replaces-with-starred-results-37288">Starred Results</a>), it's a good bet that the pure-algorithm bias is slowly seeping away. Bing uses a panel of search quality reviewers, as does Google (though the latter continues to be very secretive about it).</p>
<p>Both are looking at clickstream data (a form of user-based information).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.quora.com/Did-Bing-intentionally-copy-Googles-search-results/answer/Edmond-Lau">Here's a former Google search qualty engineer noting</a> that Google's used the same form of clickstream analysis via their toolbar that they railed against Bing for applying.</p>
<p>All of this strongly suggests that more user and usage information will be gathered and used to help rank results. It's far tougher to access than link data and, particularly hard to game without appearing &quot;unnatural&quot; compared to the normal web traffic patterns. I've talked before about <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-influence-of-usage-data">how I don't like the direct signals of clicks on search results</a>, but many ancillary data points could be collected and used, including information about where users have &quot;good&quot; user experiences on the web.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to your thoughts on the next generation of ranking signals and what Google/Bing might do next to overcome problems like <a href="http://searchengineland.com/new-york-times-exposes-j-c-penney-link-scheme-that-causes-plummeting-rankings-in-google-64529">JCPenneyGate</a>, <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/im-getting-more-worried-about-the-effectiveness-of-webspam">spam perception</a> among <a href="http://www.seobook.com/somewhere-mountainview">technophiles</a> and <a href="http://www.seobook.com/content-farms-vs">content farms</a>. It seems hard to imagine that either will simply rest on a system they know can be gamed.</p>
<p>p.s. I'd also add that vertical/universal results and more &quot;instant answers&quot; will continue to rise in importance/visibility in the SERPs for both engines (though these aren't really classic &quot;ranking signals&quot;)</p>
<p>p.p.s. If you're PRO and interested in the brand signals in particular (and some suggested brand-building tactics), feel free to&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/dp/pro-webinars">join our webinar this Friday</a>.</strong></p>

If you work in one of these industries (gambling for example) then you may have the opportunity of optimising the affiliate program to get more value from an SEO point of view. In this post I'm going to outline some of the techniques you can use along with the advantages and potential risks of both.<br />
<br />
I want to very briefly cover why some of these techniques may carry some risk. Google has traditionally sought to not pass value across links that appear to be affiliate based. I searched high and low for some official Google Webmaster Guidelines on affiliate links, all I found was <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=76465">this page</a> which talks more about content rather than links. However I did find the following quote from an interview that <a href="http://www.stonetemple.com/articles/interview-matt-cutts-012510.shtml">Eric Enge</a> did with Matt Cutts:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Eric Enge</em></strong><em>: If Googlebot sees an affiliate link out there, does it treat that link as an endorsement or an ad?<br />
<br />
<strong>Matt Cutts</strong>: Typically, we want to handle those sorts of links appropriately. A lot of the time, that means that the link is essentially driving people for money, so we usually would not count those as an endorsement.</em></p>
<p>I think the gist is that the website has only put the link in place because they are getting some financial reward for doing so. ie they get paid a commission if someone uses the link and then buys a product etc. Therefore, Google doesn't like to count them as editorially given links.<br />
<br />
There are various arguments that can be had as to whether affiliate links should be counted or not, but thats not the point of this post. All you need to know really is that Google doesn't tend to count affiliate links as editorally given, therefore you need to be careful how you use and optimise them.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for you to optimise your own affiliate program to try and get some SEO benefit from the links.</p>
<h2>1) Use of a Dedicated Landing Page for Big Affiliates</h2>
<p>I quite like this technique. The principle is that you look at who your biggest affiliates are in terms of SEO value, as well as traffic. Then you create a dedicated landing page on your domain for that affiliate to use. You can even do this so that they can still link to their own versions of deep pages such as categories or product pages.<br />
<br />
For example, if the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/dp/seomoz-pro-affiliate-program">SEOmoz affiliate program</a> were to do this, a landing page to PRO could look like -<br />
<br />
www.seomoz.org/pro/paddy<br />
<br />
This URL would look exactly the same as the URL would if it didn't have /paddy on the end. So for the user, they wouldn't notice anything different and would have the same experience.<br />
<br />
To stop the problem of having loads of duplicate content pages, you can make use of the rel=canonical tag. So on the URL www.seomoz.org/pro/paddy, I'd implement the rel=canonical which points to www.seomoz.org/pro. If you are unfamilar with rel=canonical then you should <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/complete-guide-to-rel-canonical-how-to-and-why-not">read this guide</a> from Lindsay.<br />
<br />
By doing this, you are telling Google that the /paddy page is a duplicate on the /pro page. therefore don't index it and pass any links or authority to the /pro page. It should also stop the /paddy page from showing in search results.<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, I'd say to do this for your larger affiliates, mainly because it can be a tricky process to get setup. However if you have a good developer who has some time to spend on this, you could potentially roll it out across your entire affiliate network.</p>
<h2>2) Make Sure Affiliates Link to the Correct Page</h2>
<p>We saw a case recently of a large client in a competitive industry having their own in house affiliate program. However the program had been running for quite some time. In that time the client website had undergone a few changes in terms of URL structure, so some affiliates were linking to old URLs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://lifelonghost.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/broken-link-money.jpg"><img height="264" width="394" alt="" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/broken-links(1).jpg" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />
&nbsp;Most of the time this isn't a problem if the appropriate redirects have been put in place. Unfortunately, the client site had been through more than one change of URL structure, and on one of these changes, redirects were not implemented correctly. Here is how some affiliates were linking to the client -<br />
<br />
Affiliate links to - www.client.com/category-name/<br />
<br />
302 redirect to www.client.com/keyword-category-name/<br />
<br />
301 redirect to www.client.com/optimsed-keyword-category-name/<br />
<br />
See where the problem lies here? That pesky 302 is stopping link juice from being passed to the new version of the URL. This is a common problem when multiple developers and SEO agencies work on the same site over a period of time. The first set of URL changes meant that a 302 redirect was used instead of a 301. Then when an SEO agency came along to make the URLs optimised for keywords, they use a 301, unaware that previous work had been carried out.</p>
<p>We ran some analysis and found around 600 links going to old client URLs that were not redirecting properly, all of these were from affiliates who were pretty easy to contact and get to fix the problem.<br />
<br />
The client was unaware that older affiliates were still linking to the very first version of the URL which went through several redirects, one of which being a 302 that meant that value was not being passed. So our advice was two fold -<br />
<br />
1 - Change the 302 redirect to a 301 in order to pass value to the latest version of the page<br />
<br />
2 - Contact all affiliates and ask them to update their links to the latest version of the URL. Some affiliates may not want to go to the effort of doing this, however you should point out that linking to a paid that goes via multiple redirects like this, could sometimes strip off their tracking code and not credit them for sales. They'll soon change the links!</p>
<h2>3) Help your Affiliates Make Their Content More Valuable (and get links!)</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago I wrote a Distilled blog post about <a href="http://www.distilled.co.uk/blog/seo/getting-links-and-seo-value-from-your-youtube-videos/">getting more SEO value from your YouTube videos</a>. If you take a look at this article, it tells you a way to get clean backlinks by getting people to embed your YouTube videos. If you have videos available to you, it is worthwhile adding clean links and encouraging your affiliates to embed the videos on their website. This has three benefits -<br />
<br />
1 - Your affiliates are adding more value to their own sites by having relevant, helpful videos on their site, therefore potentially increasing the click through rate to your site<br />
<br />
2 - Embedding these videos will help the overall strength of your YouTube channel<br />
<br />
3 - You get a nice additional link to your website</p>
<p>As an added incentive, you could even slightly increase commission for affiliates who embed your videos. This can help to get things kick started.</p>
<p>The end result will hopefully be something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object height="390" width="640">
<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5_sfnQDr1-o&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3" />
<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><embed height="390" width="640" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5_sfnQDr1-o&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Video by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ParryGripp">ParryGripp</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ok, I really just wanted an excuse to put a video of a baby monkey going backwards on a pig on the blog :) &nbsp;But the point is that you can add a nice clean link underneath your video.</p>
<h2>4) Add More Value to Widgets and Iframes That Affiliates Use</h2>
<p>I worked with a client recently who was looking to get a bit more benefit from their affiliate program. They are in a super competitive industry and had tons of affiliate links, so just a small change to this could result in higher click throughs and more revenue. The long term SEO benefit was also a big factor.</p>
<p>This client had embeddable chunks of content that were pulled in dynamically using an iframe. Links within the iframe couldn't be seen by the search engines, nor could they see the content, so there was no SEO value at all. A solution was to add a HTML wrapper around the iframe which contained a link to the client and the affiliate could also add some content which the search engines would see. Again, there are several benefits to this approach -</p>
<p>1 - You're adding value to the affiliate site by allowing for the option of adding content which the search engines and users can see</p>
<p>2 - You're getting an additional link back to your website<br />
<br />
Hopefully this has been useful and given you some food for thought when optimising your own affiliate programs. Any feedback or ideas you have, as always feel free to drop a comment below!</p>

<h2>Video Transcription</h2>
<blockquote>Hi, SEOmoz fans. I'm Jen Lopez. I'm a community manager here at SEOmoz. Today I'm going to be talking about how we increased our Twitter followers by over 250% in the past year. <br />
<br />
Now, I know the question is going to come up that we're not supposed to care about the actual numbers. It is not about the numbers. It's about the actual influencers and that sort of thing. That is true. It is very true. But you still, in order to get more influencers and in order to get more people retweeting your stuff, you need to get more followers. So, we're looking at the percentage that we increased and not necessarily the exact numbers. <br />
<br />
Before I really get started I should tell you that when I first started taking over the Twitter account, my biggest goal was simply to beat Rand in followers. We started and the SEOmoz account had something like 4,000 followers. That was maybe a year and a half year ago. Today we have almost 28,000. That was because I was bound and determined to beat Rand who had a good 15,000 more followers than we did. So let me tell you exactly how we did that. <br />
<br />
The first thing is we engaged. I know you're going to say, &quot;Everybody says engage with your followers.&quot; But what does that really mean, right? So, at SEOmoz, for us we use Twitter not only as a marketing tactic but as a customer service tactic. It is also a huge part of our community. Twitter for us is a little bit of everything. If somebody sends us a kudos like, &quot;Oh, I just tested out the new web app. Seriously awesome. Thank you, SEOmoz,&quot; we respond back and say, &quot;High five!&quot; or &quot;Glad you love it.&quot; Sometimes we retweet it, whatever. They get a response. That doesn't happen 100% of the time, but it happens often. <br />
<br />
The next thing that we do is if somebody complains, they get an error, they're like, &quot;Your latest post was horrible,&quot; whatever the case may be, they also get a response. Sometimes the response is, &quot;Whoa! Sorry you got that error. Can you send us a screenshot?&quot; Or, &quot;Make sure to have your third party cookies on.&quot; Whatever the case may be, they get a response. Oftentimes, once they get a response, their tone changes. They change from being mad about something to all of a sudden being like, &quot;Hey, it's cool. You responded. You got me. I'm good.&quot; <br />
<br />
We also started, if you notice, every one of our blog posts get published on [Twitter]. Oftentimes it will go up in the middle of the night in the US plus in the afternoon. What we're doing is we're trying to make sure we have a huge following from essentially all over the world. We want to make sure that it is not just the West Coasters getting great content. We schedule it so that it goes out. There are definitely ways to schedule your content and schedule tweets so that you don't look like a spammer. You're actually going in and when you are around, you reply to people. You touch base with them. The biggest part of engaging is just making sure that you are talking to people whether it is they love you, they hate you, they have a question, whatever it is; talk to them. People really appreciate it. Simply by doing that, that alone in the first year that we started making these changes to the Twitter account increased our following by about 100%. <br />
<br />
What really kicked us into over gear is we made sharing a whole lot easier on the site. I don't know if you remember, but at least 6 months ago, it was really difficult to share any content on our site. If you wanted to share a post, you had to scroll down way at the bottom, there was a &quot;share this&quot; button, I believe. Then you click &quot;share this&quot; and you have like 500 options of what you're to do next. Most users aren't going to do that. They don't want to have to think. I go to a website and I want to share something, I don't want to think about it. I want to click a button that says &quot;Tweet Me&quot; and let it take me off to Twitter. So, that's what we changed. When we redesigned the site, we made Twitter and Facebook very prominent on the site. So not only actually has our Twitter followers increased, but our Facebook fans have about tripled also, just by, again, making it easier for people to share your content. <br />
<br />
Again, as I'm talking about this, these are the tactics that we have taken to increase our followers. It may not necessarily work with what you're doing. You may not be in a business where you necessarily want to talk to people who are hating your product or whatever the case may be. But this has worked for us, and it has increased our reach by thousands and thousands. If you look at Klout and you look at where we were before and where we are now, the difference is actually amazing. The next step in this is actually to do a post that shows you some really distinct numbers and that sort of thing that I can show you the difference and what our reach is now as opposed to what it used to be. <br />
<br />
Other than making sharing easier, we've also added it to emails. You get an email from the customer service team and we say, &quot;Hey, did you get an awesome experience with customer service? Tweet about it.&quot; We send an email about the webinar coming up. We're like, &quot;Don't forget to tell your friends about it.&quot; Whatever you do, make it really easy to share. I've received emails from my dentist that say, &quot;Forward this to a friend,&quot; or &quot;Share this with your friend on Twitter.&quot; Whatever you do, think about all the ways that you market or that you do customer service and figure out how you can add Twitter into that. <br />
<br />
The last one is, we involved everyone. Even though we increased our talking from the actual Twitter account, where it is really Roger, so oftentimes, you know, Roger he really loves to get on Twitter and just chat it up with people. Sometimes he woots and whees and beeps a little bit. But it was really important actually to involve everyone. So we have asked everyone that if you see someone that has a question about a tool, someone who is asking about the best guide to SEO and we have that content, or if you just see anything out there where I can't be on there 100%. I can't be online at all times. Even though, if you know me well, you probably know that I'm mostly online all of the time. So, we involved. Rand, if Rand sees a question come through to SEOmoz, he'll respond to it and he'll CC the SEOmoz account so that we know it has been covered. Same with Joanna or SEOmom, they do the same thing. We have also involved our associates like Dr. Pete, the entire distilled staff, so the people that you see posting on the blog and that sort of thing. I've also asked them, if you see questions, whatever it is, talk to people. Remind them, hey, there's this post over here or there's this app over here or don't forget you can send an email to help@seomoz.org and they'll be able to give you more information or help you with your problem. <br />
<br />
Then, here we have Mozzers just in general. We have some of our great community members who have also helped us. They've taken it upon themselves to jump into conversations, involve people into the SEOmoz community through Twitter. For us, like I said before, Twitter is not just a marketing tactic to us. It is involving people in the community. It's telling them about community events whether it is a meet-up or a webinar coming up or discounts to a conference, whatever the case may be. We use Twitter for everything talking to our community. <br />
<br />
So, these are the main three tactics that we've used over the past about a year and a half to increase our followers. The other thing that we often look at is increasing our reach and taking a look at our influencers, because we want to make sure that not only are we gaining followers but we're gaining followers who are the equivalent to the linkerati. We want the social linkerati. We want these people who like to retweet, who like to send your information out. We want those people to be following us and to be engaged with us. We will often jump into a conversation and be a part of it simply because we know that having that touch point with someone makes them feel more a part of the community. I've done it in person, too. I talk to people in person and mention Twitter, and the next thing you know, I see that they're following us. It is just really important to get out, talk to your people, and engage them. <br />
<br />
I would really love to hear what's working for you. What do you do? What is your tactic to gaining followers, finding those influencers, and how do you use Twitter? I hope that you guys will forgive me that perhaps I am not as eloquent as Rand. I really loved doing the Whiteboard Friday today. Aaron who is back there taking the video is laughing at me at the moment. I would just like everyone to know that. Anyway, thank you everyone. I hope you have a great weekend. We'll see you next week for another Whiteboard Friday.</blockquote>

From all across the realm, downtrodden webmasters would travel to pay homage to the ones called Editors, that those keepers of the Categories might bequeath a link of great PageRank upon them. Woe upon those who did not have the light of the most open directory, as their websites would surely wither and perish.</p>
<p>Sadly, that's not far from the way many people saw DMOZ in the past, and that attitude still persists in 2011. It's easy to understand why &ndash; a free yet authoritative directory that even now has a Toolbar PR of 8 is certainly an attractive link target. Unfortunately, when we quest after high authority mega-directories, we sometimes miss that the SEO and traffic value of the link we can actually get (one buried deep in subcategories) is virtually non-existent.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Are The Pages?</strong></h2>
<p>This post came out of Q&amp;A, where we've had multiple questions about new DMOZ links not showing up in Open Site Explorer. To be honest, the timing and depth of these links means that OSE doesn't always catch them, but in almost every case that I dug into, the DMOZ pages in question weren't being indexed by Google, either.</p>
<p>In many cases, these links end up in one of the Regional categories. Let's look at an example, the DMOZ regional listing for <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/Colorado/Localities/D/Denver/Business_and_Economy/Computers_and_Internet/Web_Design_and_Development/" rel="nofollow">website developers in Denver</a>. The URL is a bit too long to display here, but it's 11 folders deep (10 below the root).</p>
<p>Although Google shows a cached copy, there's nothing <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/Colorado/Localities/D/Denver/Business_and_Economy/Computers_and_Internet/Web_Design_and_Development/">in the index</a>. Even the cached copy is over 2-1/2 months old. Unfortunately, no indexation means no link-juice gets passed.</p>
<h2><strong>Where Did It Go Wrong?</strong></h2>
<p>I'm not here just to pick on DMOZ &ndash; I want to illustrate how, as you dive deep into a site (even a very high-authority site), it's easy to lose link-juice fast. Let's pick apart that DMOZ link, level by level. The following table shows whether each level is indexed by Google and OSE, as well as the Toolbar PR and SEOmoz PA scores for the page:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img height="305" width="591" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/dmoz-love-1.gif" alt="DMOZ Folder Analysis" /></p>
<p>It's easy to see that PR falls rapidly at Level 6, and indexation stops soon after. It's also interesting that, in this case, OSE is actually crawling deeper than Google (I honestly didn't expect that).</p>
<p>I should point out that these listing pages are hardly unloved orphans, in the scheme of DMOZ.  The Denver <i>Business_and_Economy</i> page lists 1,017 companies, and even the deepest <i>Web_Design_and_Development</i> level has 35 listings. Keep in mind that these are also web developers, who are probably eager to see their listing count for something.</p>
<h2><strong>Can You Save The Love?</strong></h2>
<p>There are cases where enterprising SEOs may find it worth their while to get someone else's page indexed. You could build your own links to the deep DMOZ listing page, promote it in social media, etc., nudging the crawlers to take action. In this case, though, you really have to ask if it's worth the trouble. The final resting place of this link is, unfortunately, just that &ndash; a link-juice graveyard. You could give it link-juice by linking to it, of course, but that effort is probably better spent on building your own, direct links.</p>
<h2><strong>Is There Someone for Me?</strong></h2>
<p>There are plenty of fish in the sea, even without DMOZ, right? Let's look at another revered PR8 directory and coveted link source, the Yahoo Directory. Surely, the Yahoo regional listing for <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/U_S__States/Colorado/Cities/Denver/Business_and_Shopping/Business_to_Business/Communications_and_Networking/Internet_and_World_Wide_Web/Web_Site_Designers/" rel="nofollow">web developers in Denver</a> must be loved by Google?</p>
<p>That's right &ndash; that subcategory page <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:dir.yahoo.com/Regional/U_S__States/Colorado/Cities/Denver/Business_and_Shopping/Business_to_Business/Communications_and_Networking/Internet_and_World_Wide_Web/Web_Site_Designers/">is not indexed</a> in Google or OSE, and it has no TBPR or PA, even though it contains 27 active (and presumably bought and paid for) listings.</p>
<p>Does this mean big directories are a thing of the past? No, but it does mean that your infatuation may be more shallow than you think. There's a lot more to the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/10-illustrations-on-search-engines-valuation-of-links">value of a link</a>&nbsp;than the TBPR or authority of the domain, and, if you're not careful, you might just find that your love is unrequited.</p>

<p><strong>Update (February 10th):</strong>&nbsp;Despite my effort to nofollow the link, Google decided to mess with me (thanks for the heads up, Aaron B.) and index that DMOZ page, which now has a 2/10/11 cache date. I'm sure there's a lesson in here somewhere, but I refuse to learn it. It does suggest that even a nofollowed link and a few clickthroughs can kick the crawlers into gear.</p>
