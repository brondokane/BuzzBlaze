<p>Ever since the 1980s, there has been an increasing amount of media coverage on stress-related topics. For decades, scientists, researchers, and doctors have been investigating how the human body responds to stress, and whether it is possible for some people to become addicted to stress. </p>
<p>While there are no hard figures to reveal how many Americans may be suffering from stress addiction, experts do agree that people suffering from this problem face varying degrees of danger to their health. </p>
<p>Are you addicted to stress? And if so, does that mean you will be facing serious health problems down the road? Or, will you be one of the few people who benefits from stress addiction?</p>
<p><strong>The Type A Paradox<br />
</strong><br />
A bevy of medical experts have noted that there are a variety of human responses to stress, and not all of them have to be negative. In fact, high-strung Type-A personalities may actually benefit from stressful lifestyles based on their genetics and lifestyle preferences.</p>
<p>&#8221;Anyone familiar with the corporate world has had experiences with driven executives who seem to thrive on stressful circumstances that most others could not tolerate,&#8221; says <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E0D81339F935A15754C0A965948260&#038;pagewanted=1">Dr. Waino W. Suojanen</a>, a professor of management at Georgia State University. &#8221;There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that some executives deliberately seek out the management life because they get a high out of controlling people. Indeed, the making of decisions seems to become addicting.&#8221;</p>
<p>So why would someone benefit from stress addiction? <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E0D81339F935A15754C0A965948260&#038;pagewanted=2">Dr. Robert Ader</a> of the University of Rochester, has studied stress addiction for many years, and he explains that stress can actually have some beneficial effects on the body. &#8221;Through our animal work we have hypothesized that it might be possible that some people might need stress because it elicits the release of catecholamines, such as adrenaline, in the blood stream, and this is not necessarily bad because it might increase resistance to some types of disease.&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E0D81339F935A15754C0A965948260&#038;pagewanted=2">Dr. Paul J. Rosch</a> adds that because of these unexpected health benefits of stress, prescribing the right medical treatments can be very challenging. &#8220;The Type A individual has perhaps become addicted to his own adrenaline and unconsciously seeks ways to get those little surges,” he explains. </p>
<p>“The Type A individual is apt to be irritable and depressed. Thus, recuperating from a heart attack by spending three weeks on a deserted beach might be a perfect prescription for one individual, but lethal for some Type A&#8217;s, who would be &#8216;off the wall&#8217; in a matter of hours.”</p>
<p><strong>Stress and Genetics<br />
</strong><br />
Stress, when combined with certain genetic factors, can increase a person’s risk for developing depression or even <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E2DF153FF932A15757C0A9609C8B63">chronic fatigue disorder</a>. According to <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stress-and-depression/MY01649">Dr. David Mrazek</a>, “People with a genetic variant of the serotonin transporter gene [are] more likely to become depressed [if] they have experienced stressful situations.” </p>
<p>While he notes that the types of stress caused by childhood abuse or major medical are more likely to affect those with the genetic variant, even “the hassles of everyday life [were] associated with an increased risk of depression if a person had this genetic variant.”</p>
<p><strong>Stress While Pregnant<br />
</strong><br />
Even if you are one of the rare people who thrive under stressful circumstances, all bets are off if you are a woman who becomes pregnant. Stress is arguably the most dangerous thing a pregnant woman can be exposed to. Stress during pregnancy has been linked to all kinds of ill effects for the developing baby. </p>
<p>For example, stress can cause <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6644-stress-can-make-pregnant-women-miscarry.html">miscarriages</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6298909.stm">lower IQ</a> scores for babies, and can affect the development of the child’s immune system.  In fact, <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/107986.php">one Harvard study</a> revealed that children who had mothers with highly stressful pregnancies were more likely to suffer from auto-immune disease, including asthma and allergies.</p>
<p><strong>Stress Addiction Warning Signs<br />
</strong><br />
According to <a href="http://www.intent.com/debbiemandel/blog/do-they-have-adult-cliff-notes-signs-you-are-addicted-stress">Debbie Mandel</a>, author of &#8220;Addicted to Stress: A Woman&#8217;s 7 Step Program to Reclaim Joy and Spontaneity in Life&#8221;, there are many warning signs that can indicate that a person has become addicted to stress. Mandel says that if you answer “yes” to any of the questions below, you may be at risk for developing stress addiction:</p>
<p>“1.	Do you tune out during conversations thinking about other things?<br />
2.       Do you feel rushed wherever you are because you feel that you ought to be completing the next task somewhere else?<br />
3. 	Do you feel uncomfortable, worried, and nervous in your mind or body when you don’t have something you must absolutely do right now?”<br />
 <br />
Mandel says that clients she treats for stress addiction get hooked on the surge of adrenaline they get when rushing around, frantically trying to check off items on their to-do lists. Many stress addicts, she adds, are also using their stress to keep from dealing with feelings of inadequacy. “In the case of stress addiction, all this busyness stems from the addict’s constant need to prove the self, suppressing feelings of unattractiveness, unworthiness and inadequacy seeping out through the seams of body and soul. It is a case of compulsion versus passion,” she explains.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br />
</strong><br />
There are good kinds of stress, and bad kinds of stress. Falling in love definitely counts as “good stress”, and getting fired is unquestionably “bad stress”. No two causes of stress are created equal, and it also seems that no two people will have the exact same response a given stressful event. </p>
<p>Even if you thrive on stress, your addiction may be putting your health at risk. As with everything in life, moderation is best. So, if you absolutely love the adrenaline rush of multi-tasking on 12 urgent projects, you need to make sure you find a little time each day to relax. Examine your motivations for reveling in stress, and make sure you balance your long-term health with your lifestyle choices.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>If you’re anything like me, you wake up in the morning, hit the ground running, work through lunch, and only stop thinking about your job when your head hits the pillow. So, needless to say, I occasionally have days where I’m stressed out of my mind. </p>
<p>According to <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E0D81339F935A15754C0A965948260&#038;pagewanted=2">Dr. Paul J. Rosch</a>, the president of the American Institute of Stress, &#8221;Americans increasingly seem to be living life in the fast lane. A better understanding of the harm that stress can cause, as well as the possibility of some benefits, would help an increasing number of people.”</p>
<p>You may think that your day is too jam-packed with meetings and events to find the time for relaxation&#8230;and you’d be wrong. Believe it or not, you can take measures to reduce your stress levels that will only take 45 seconds of your time. Here are ten tips that can help you de-stress in record time.</p>
<p><strong>1. Read a Poem</strong></p>
<p>Take 45 seconds to savor a single haiku, or read over your favorite sonnet. Beautiful language can really twist your mind in a way that helps to push away the cares of the day.</p>
<p>And even if poetry isn’t really your thing, you might find enjoyment in reading something with a humorous bent. Think Shel Silverstein, Ogden Nash, or Dr. Seuss.</p>
<p><strong>2. Blow Off Some Steam</strong></p>
<p>Get up and get moving, just for the amount of time it takes to hum a couple rounds of “Happy Birthday”. If you can burn off some of that nervous energy, you’ll feel energized, refreshed, and far more mentally capable of handling the stresses of your day.</p>
<p>If you can get some sun in during those precious few seconds, so much the better. Never underestimate the power of fresh air and sunshine to improve your mood. </p>
<p><strong>3. Follow Your Nose</strong></p>
<p>I’ve written about the benefits of aromatherapy in <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/olfactory-life-hacks-scents-that-increase-brain-power.html">a previous post</a> here, and I’m still impressed by the speed with which a single sniff of perfume can change my mood. If you don’t have essential oils on hand, peel an orange at your desk and crush the rind in your hand to release the scent of the orange. Orange is a great scent to help you feel energized and rejuvenated.</p>
<p><strong>4. Elevate Your Brain</strong></p>
<p>Meditate, pray, commune with nature&#8230;whatever works for you. Take a few moments to center yourself, open your mind, and get spiritual&#8230;if that sort of thing is helpful for you.</p>
<p><strong>5. Pump Your Jam</strong></p>
<p>There’s a reason that sporting arenas play songs when introducing the starting lineup for a sports team. The right song can change your outlook on life in under 45 seconds. The trick is to find a song snippet that works for you. </p>
<p>Maybe it’s the &#8220;Tro lo lo&#8221; guy, something off a Jock Jams compilation album, or the over-the-top intro to “The Final Countdown”. Alternatively, maybe a snippet of something classical would be better for calming you. It comes down to personal preference, and exactly what about your day has got you so stressed out.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Don’t Forget to Breathe</strong></p>
<p>Breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth. Slowly. Repeat. Make sure the breaths are steady and full.</p>
<p>It’s just that simple.</p>
<p><strong>7. Chuckle</strong></p>
<p>Hit the randomizer button on your favorite web comic, engage in cube warfare with a co-worker, or check out a website that offers a “Joke of the Day” service. Laughter really is the best medicine, and if you can laugh away the stress, your outlook for the rest of the day will be a lot more rosy.</p>
<p><strong>8. Organize</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the best way to tackle stress is to clean house and get organized. Set up a new email filter, organize your paperwork, clean the clutter off your desk, or something along those lines. When you have all your ducks in a row, so to speak, your workload will seem a lot more manageable. </p>
<p><strong>9. Snuggle Up</strong></p>
<p>Get cuddly with a pet, a blanket, a favorite sweater&#8230;.anything soft that you stroke with your fingertips. Just like Lenny in “Of Mice and Men”, most people find that they reach their “happy place” when touching something soft like fur or textiles. Scratching a dog or cat behind the ears can help to quickly lower your blood pressure&#8230;if there aren’t any pets allowed in your office, try carrying a lucky rabbit’s foot.</p>
<p><strong>10. Chow Down</strong></p>
<p>Eating or drinking helps to relax us. That’s why we give pacifiers to babies. Just try to make sure you’re making smart food choices (ie, choose a crunchy apple over a bag of potato chips). </p>

<p>I’m not particularly gifted (sigh) but I <em>am</em> pretty driven. I choose to be proactive, focused and disciplined (mostly) because I’m fascinated by what we human beings can achieve when we commit to exploring our potential and when we don’t allow our thinking or emotions to get in the way of our possibilities. In some ways, I guess my drive and determination come (in part) from my lack of inherent ability.</p>
<p>Who knew that being not-very-talented would have an upside?</p>
<p>Growing up, I wasn’t a great athlete, student, musician or a great <em>anything</em> for that matter. I was good at a few things (okay, eating), average at a few more and pretty crap at a whole bunch of things. For all the money my parents spent on years of guitar lessons, I should be frickin’ Carlos Santana, Jimi Hendrix and Slash all rolled into one. If only there had been some musical ability in the mix, I could have been anything.</p>
<p>Based on what I still remember (and can still play), I think my parents invested somewhere in the vicinity of four thousand dollars per chord. Having said that, if you ever need somebody to belt out a horrible acoustic rendition of <em>House of the Rising Sun</em> at your next party, I’m your guy.</p>
<p>What do you mean – “no thanks”?</p>
<p>That hurts.</p>
<p>And if, per chance, something is in need of repair at your house, whatever you do, don’t ask me to fix it. Sure, I may <em>look</em> handy but don’t be fooled; as a repairman, I’m about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike. Combine my total lack of technical and mechanical aptitude with my enormous-for-no-good-reason ego, my enthusiasm, my unwarranted optimism (about my potential to <em>fix</em> things) and my ineptitude with tools – and I’m sure to create more havoc than harmony at your place.  </p>
<p>The strange thing is, part of me always thinks I’m going to be able to fix whatever it is I’m taking apart – despite my abysmal track record. It’s the one area that I don’t seem to learn in. Maybe it’s my over-developed optimism-gene kicking in. Fortunately, I’ve always had girlfriends with great mechanical aptitude. And large forearms.</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>Enough about me.</p>
<p><strong>Your Best Life</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to the matter of creating and sustaining our <em>best</em> <em>life</em> (whatever that means to each of us personally), the question we should ask ourselves is <em>not</em>, “how much potential do I have?” but rather, “how much of that potential am I currently using?”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I published a <a href="http://www.craigharper.com.au/health-nutrition/a-readers-letter/comment-page-2/#comment-20204">fantastic letter</a> I received from Mel - one of our readers and part of our community. If you haven’t read it, I suggest you take a peek. Her achievement of creating and maintaining such a significant change in her world is inspirational. She lost 56 kgs (123 lbs) and has kept it off for a year and a half. But more important than the weight-loss (in my opinion), is the fact that she has also created and maintained amazing change on many levels beyond the physical.</p>
<p>Go Mel.</p>
<p>After years of stopping and starting. Of wasting time. Of not reaching her goal. Of living in a body which embarrassed her. Of feeling self-conscious. Of hiding in her house. Of crying. Of avoiding people. Of pretending to be happy. Of shortness of breath. Of poor health. Of chaffing. And of walking to the letterbox in the dark… Mel changed. Massively.  She transformed her body, her thinking, her habits, her behaviours and her life.</p>
<p>Her entire reality.</p>
<p>Now, we could spend hours debating and discussing why it took her so long (to change once and for all) but the pertinent question for this chat is:</p>
<p>Did she always have the potential to create amazing change?</p>
<p>Of course, the answer is <em>yes</em>. She didn’t wake up one day and miraculously possess more potential. No, she woke up one day and started using what had always been there. And to keep using it no matter what. What she didn’t always have was the mindset, the awareness, the discipline or the momentum – but she always had the <em>potential</em> for incredible transformation.</p>
<p>For a range of reasons, there was a time when she was not (genuinely) ready. Not prepared to pay the price. Not willing to get <em>that</em> uncomfortable. Not willing to face her fears. The potential was there but it wasn’t being exploited – kind of like the guy who buys the amazing car and then leaves it in the garage because he’s too scared somebody might scratch it. Or resent his success. Or steal it when he’s not looking.</p>
<p>And when Mel created the right internal environment - when she got to <em>that</em> point – she opened the door to something that was always there: her own personal world of amazing. Her potential.</p>
<p><strong>You and Me?</strong></p>
<p>The amount of inherent potential you and I have is finite but how much of that potential we use is completely optional. Isn’t that great news? Of course, there’s no way of knowing, measuring or quantifying exactly how much potential we each have – or how much of that potential we will typically use in a lifetime (various figures like <em>three</em> <em>percent</em> get thrown around)  - but it’s my belief, observation and experience that most of us don’t use most of what we have.</p>
<p>So the next obvious question is…</p>
<p><strong>What Stops us from Exploring, Developing and Maximising our Potential? </strong></p>
<p>A bunch of things but mostly, it’s a fear thing.</p>
<p>Fear of failure. Of embarrassment. Of being judged. Of the unknown. Of being ridiculed. Of the commitment required. Of the potential pain, discomfort and risk. The day we decide that we’re prepared to deal with those inevitable realities of the human experience, and the day we stop trying to keep everybody except ourselves happy, is the day the transformation begins.</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve spent years making mistakes. Taking risks. Being criticised. Embarrassed. Judged. Labelled. Liked. Disliked. I’m okay with all of it because where there’s discomfort, there’s growth. There’s learning. And in the middle of it all, I found me. Despite many protests, I went to university (for the first time) at thirty-six. After being told that I wouldn’t get a book published, I wrote my first book at thirty-seven. I did my first (regular) TV gig at forty-two. I didn’t know what a blog was at forty-one. I’ve had two failed businesses. In order to build my speaking skills, I did hundreds of presentations for little or no money. For years. Some of them were horrible. I was horrible. My ‘apprenticeship’ into the world of professional speaking was a ten-year journey. I could go on, but I don’t want to bore you. Needless to say, my failures lessons far outweigh my triumphs.</p>
<p>In some ways, the ‘safest’ thing for me to do would be to <em>not</em> share my thoughts, ideas, opinions and beliefs in such a public way. Some people don’t like it. Doing what I do – sharing my philosophies with a large audience – means that I will be criticised, disliked and uncomfortable on a regular basis. That’s okay, I’ll simply choose to live, laugh, love and learn. Because I can.</p>
<p>One of my favourite mentors at university (Dr. Paul Callery) once told me:</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to offend anyone, then say nothing, do nothing and be nothing.”</p>
<p>Smart man.</p>
<p>I’ll finish today’s post with a message I often share with my charges:</p>
<p>I don’t care how young, old, fat, fit, tall, small, genetically gifted, intelligent, qualified, skilled, experienced or inherently talented you are (or aren’t), all I care about (in terms of you creating lasting change in your world), is what you do with what you’ve been given. You can’t change your genetics but you can change how you use them. You can’t change your chronological age but you can change what <em>you</em> <em>do</em> (choices, behaviours, habits) at your age. And in the process, you can lower your biological age. You can’t change other people but you can change how you behave and react around them. You can’t alter your level of natural ability (potential), but you can determine how much of that ability you tap into, exploit and develop. You can’t change your past but you can change the way you let it influence and impact on your present and your future. That is, you don’t need to be limited by, defined by or determined by your history (as many people are). Your history doesn’t necessarily tell you anything about your potential and is often a poor indicator of what’s possible for your future. If you’re like many, then your achievements – or perhaps lack of achievements – are more a reflection of your fear (to take a chance and get uncomfortable) than they are a reflection of your potential.</p>
<p>And finally, don’t allow your self-limiting, over-thinking, fear-influenced mind to stand between you and happiness. You are good enough, talented enough, courageous enough and definitely worth it.</p>
<p>Enjoy your journey.</p>
<p>And your potential.</p>

<h2>Start your own website.</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of websites &#8211; the ones that sell products and the ones that provide information.</p>
<p>If you can think of a good idea for a webstore and invest enough time and energy into marketing it, you might do well.  But keep in mind, you will have to constantly keep at it.  There will be orders to fill and plenty of accounting and inventory work to keep you busy,  provided you have a good product, there&#8217;s demand, and you&#8217;ve marketed yourself well.  The &#8220;If you build it they will come&#8221; slogan does not apply to websites.  If no one knows you&#8217;re out there, the chances of them accidentally stumbling upon it are virtually nil.  It can also be expensive if you don&#8217;t know how to create or operate your website, or how to market it.  You may very likely need to enlist the help of paid professionals.</p>
<p>If the idea of running an online store does not appeal to you, perhaps you&#8217;d like to create a website that offers information, rather than products.  It could be that you make brilliant cartoons and think that would get a following, or perhaps you&#8217;d like to start up a news blog or maybe even a site for dog owners.  There&#8217;s no limit as to what topics you have to choose from, but my advice is to choose something that you love.</p>
<p><strong><em>My experience:</em></strong></p>
<p>I started up a news website along with my husband in 2006.  We are both news junkies who love to write.  I always wanted to be a journalist,  but I knew where that career field was heading and I didn&#8217;t really want to be an intern or do time as the obituary writer.  So we took our passion for news and for writing and our love for our hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, and we started up a news site.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say that we&#8217;ve gotten rich off of it,  but it helps pay the bills.  It&#8217;s daily traffic rivals and surpasses that of established news media outlets in our market, and we&#8217;ve brought on board some award-winning journalists in recent years.  It&#8217;s also gotten us other opportunities over the years, such as press passes to concerts and sporting events, chances to test out new products or listen to unreleased CDs, and so on.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve stuck with it for so long because it is something that we enjoy.  I can&#8217;t stress this enough &#8211; if you start a website about something that you are not passionate about, chances are you will burn out pretty quickly.  It takes a lot of work to build up a successful website, and you have to be willing to put in the time yourself until it is big enough that you need to bring in some extra help.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve saved a lot of costs because I know how to build websites and have a background in graphic design and a bit of SEO know-how. If you don&#8217;t have these skills, or a friend who might be willing to lend some of their talent, it will end up costing you more.</p>
<h2>Answer questions, do surveys, and conduct searches.</h2>
<p>This tactic to making money online will most definitely not make you rich, but can help you earn enough to pay for the little things you&#8217;d be buying anyways, or give you some extra spending money to treat yourself every once in awhile.</p>
<p>There are plenty of opportunities to take surveys for money.  This has never appealed to me, so I can&#8217;t honestly direct you to a legit one.  They&#8217;re out there, but do your research first.  Otherwise you might just find yourself added to another spam distribution list.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re good at searching for information online and have an interest in a wide variety of topics, becoming a ChaCha.com guide might be up your alley.  People ask questions, you find them the answers, and then you get paid.  The more time you spend working, the more you will make.</p>
<p>If you use the internet, you probably use a search engine regularly.  Well what if all those searches you conducted could earn you money?  With SwagBucks.com, you can earn money for your searches.  It pays you to do what you&#8217;d already be doing on Google, Yahoo, Bing or whatever your favorite search engine is. You again won&#8217;t get rich by doing this, but you can build up enough points to score gift cards to Amazon.com and other places.</p>
<p><strong><em>My experience: </em></strong></p>
<p>I did a few surveys for AOL way back in the day that they paid me for, but these kind of things haven&#8217;t interested me all that much because they don&#8217;t pay out all that well and I&#8217;m more interested in making a living online than earning some extra spending money.  But I know people who have done these and are pleased with it.</p>
<h2>Find a work from home job.</h2>
<p>They are out there, but they&#8217;re hard to find and pretty darn competitive.  These jobs can range from a medical transcriptionist to a search engine optimization specialist.  Or, perhaps, you could find a position as a social media consultant.</p>
<p><strong><em>My experience:</em></strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen these from time to time posted on Craigslist, but I&#8217;ve never actually gotten one yet.  My advice to finding them is to scour the job postings on not only your local city, but some big cities like New York as well.  Often times there will be work from home jobs posted on only the NYC Craigslist because that&#8217;s where the company is based out of, that&#8217;s their local Craigslist, and they don&#8217;t want to go to the bother of posting it on all of the cities.   You&#8217;d apply for these jobs the same way you&#8217;d do any other job, and your interview will likely be over the phone, unless you happen to be near where the company is based.</p>
<h2>Write about what you know.</h2>
<p>Do you have a degree in nutrition?  I know Livestrong.com is hiring writers for their site through Demand Media Studios.  DMS also hiring writers and editors for every other topic under the sun to be published on eHow.com and their numerous other web properties.  You can make about $15 or more per article, and a few dollars for each article that you edit.  You can work as much or as little as you want.  Once you &#8220;claim&#8221; an assignment, of which there are tens of thousands, you have 7 days to complete it.</p>
<p>Yahoo bought up Associated Content and have amassed their own army of writers to create articles on numerous topics.  They also utilize their writers to do local feature stories for Yahoo Local cities.  They work similarly to Demand Media Studios, in that you can &#8220;claim&#8221; assignments.  I signed up to see how it worked, and it seems as though most of the payment for them is &#8220;performance based&#8221;.  In other words, you get paid based on the number of hits your article gets.</p>
<p>Scour the blogger job postings on ProBlogger.net.  There are lots of people hiring everyday for people to write blogs for them on numerous topics.</p>
<p><strong><em>My experience:</em></strong></p>
<p>I signed up with Demand Media Studios and was accepted, but I haven&#8217;t done much since. The number of assignments available and is somewhat overwhelming, but I could easily earn the equivalent of a 9 to 5 salary by writing articles every day.  I&#8217;ve written for many, many blogs and websites over the years about everything from lawncare to nursing school and mobile phones.  There are topics, such as new technology, that I consider myself to be well-versed in and there are others that I am not that familiar with, so I do a lot of research to write well about them.</p>
<h2>Turn your talent into cash.</h2>
<p>Most people have at least one talent.  Figure out what yours is, and come up with a plan to capitalize on it. This is what finding a work from home job is all about.  If you love to knit, why not sell your goods on Etsy?  Are you an awesome coder?  There&#8217;s more work out there than you&#8217;ll know what to do with.  Are you an expert gardener?  Start a blog and share your tips, or maybe even make some expert how-to videos for eHow.com.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to quit your job and start working from home overnight.  It will likely take you some time to progress to a full work from home job, so start out small and work your way up.  If what you do is something that you love you&#8217;ll be more successful.  You need to be dedicated and motivated, and not easily distracted by the freedoms that working from home offers.  Successfully earning a living by working at home CAN be done, but it will most certainly take a lot of hard work.</p><div class="feedflare">

If you watched the movie &#8220;The Social Network&#8221; or are in tune with current culture, then you probably know the jist of the Facebook story and how it&#8217;s grown, so I won&#8217;t bore you with the details.  These days, if you&#8217;re in business, have made a name for yourself or want to make a name for yourself, you need to be on Facebook. Why? Let me explain.</p>
<p>Back in the 1980s and even the 1990s, if your business wasn&#8217;t listed in the phonebook, you had to rely on word of mouth to be discovered by potential new customers.  Then along came the internet and slowly businesses started putting up websites.  It was great because you could put a lot more information on a website than you could in a small add in the Yellow Pages.  With the internet well established now, most businesses do have some kind of web presence.  If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re losing out on a lot of potential business. It&#8217;s like the phonebook of yesteryear &#8211; you need to be on it.</p>
<p>Now, in the past few years, social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter have grown into something more than just a place to connect with old friends or classmates.  It&#8217;s now a way to give your business a public face to interact with the world and your customers.   If you&#8217;re not on Facebook, you&#8217;re missing out on potential customers. The same goes for Twitter.</p>
<p>As a consumer, I&#8217;ve found both Facebook and Twitter to be excellent ways to interact with companies.  Instead of calling customer service and then being put on hold forever, only to be connected with someone who can barely speak English, I can post a message on their Facebook wall or send them a message.  If I really want quick action, I&#8217;ll @ reply them on Twitter. Companies are a lot more responsive, especially if you have a complaint, if it&#8217;s out there for the whole word to see.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just lodging complaints that Facebook and Twitter are good for.  Since Facebook and Twitter are sites that people visit every day, you can use your account to constantly put out information about your company and to interact.  This will keep your company fresh in their mind, more often than if you just had a website because they&#8217;d only visit it when they need to.  Social media is like commercials on television for a business; you can get your info on the streams of hundreds, thousands, and even millions of people easily and for free.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t own a business?  It&#8217;s still a good idea to be involved.  Whether you&#8217;re an entreprenuer, a freelancer, or a working stiff, you&#8217;ll find benefits to utilizing social media.  As a business and website owner, I can&#8217;t even begin to tell you how many contacts I have made through social media.  It&#8217;s gotten me interviews with people, press passes to concerts, PR contacts, media contacts, new writers, and so much more.  If I did not have a social media presence and if my business did not have a social media presence, I can&#8217;t imagine where we would be today.  As a freelance writer, I&#8217;ve also utilized social media to promote myself and gain contacts, and it also gives people who read  some of my work to interact with me personally.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the market for a new job, you know how important connections are.  Networking, networking, networking is key.  While it probably helps more to know someone in &#8220;real life&#8221;, you can still make connections online that could help you now or in the future.</p>
<p>If you are one of the social networking holdouts, it&#8217;s time to reconsider.  If security is your concern, rest assured that if someone really wanted to find where you live, they could do so easily without having to look you up on Facebook. You&#8217;re missing out on opportunities by not giving you or your business a public face on these social networking sites.

<p>During the course of any given day at the office, you undoubtedly drink coffee to help you stay alert, or try deep breathing exercises to calm your nerves after a particularly harrowing staff meeting. But what if there was an easier way to regulate your moods and trick your brain into performing to its peak potential?</p>
<p>For many people, one simple life hack that can bring about an almost instant improvement in productivity is aromatherapy. By simply smelling the correct scents, you can lower your blood pressure, sharpen your mind, and improve your outlook on life. </p>
<p><strong>The Science of Aromatherapy</strong></p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/aromatherapy-000347.htm">University of Maryland Medical Center</a>, aromatherapy as a science had its start in the early 20th century. “René-Maurice Gattefossé, a French chemist, discovered the healing properties of lavender oil when he applied it to a burn on his hand caused by an explosion in his laboratory. He then started to analyze the chemical properties of essential oils and how they were used to treat burns, skin infections, gangrene, and wounds in soldiers during World War I.”</p>
<p>The process is still not well understood by modern doctors and scientists, however. According to the experts at UMMC: “Some experts believe our sense of smell may play a role. The &#8220;smell&#8221; receptors in your nose communicate with parts of your brain (the amygdala and hippocampus) that serve as storehouses for emotions and memories. When you breathe in essential oil molecules, some researchers believe that they stimulate these parts of your brain and influence physical, emotional, and mental health.”</p>
<p><strong>What Scents Are Best For You?</strong></p>
<p>The majority of aromatherapy benefits fall into one of four categories: Energizing/Invigorating, Stress Relief, Sleep Aids, or Mood Elevators. By placing a few drops of these essential oils into a diffuser in your home or office, you can feel the benefits of being exposed to these healing scents. Switch up the essential oils at a moment’s notice to trick your brain into performing the tasks you need to accomplish.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of some of the most popular scents, along with their benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Energizing/Invigorating:</strong> Orange, Rosemary, Lemon.</p>
<p><strong>Stress Relief:</strong> Jasmine, Lavender, Ylang Ylang, Clary Sage.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep Aids:</strong> Lavender, Chamomile, Sandalwood, Vetiver.</p>
<p><strong>Mood Elevators</strong>: Mint, Basil Oil, Bergamot.</p>
<p>So on a day when you need to improve your mental focus, you might want to eat an orange at your desk, and leave the rind nearby where you can smell it. Conversely, if you need to ensure a good night’s sleep before a big presentation that’s got you stressed out, consider sleeping with a lavender sachet under your pillow, or setting up a lavender essential oil diffuser in your bedroom about half an hour before you plan to hit the hay.</p>
<p>You can use diffusers or nebulizers to aerate the oil. Alternatively, you can apply some essential oils directly to the skin to reap their benefits. Make sure to read the directions carefully before using any essential oils to make sure you are going to use it in a way that will give you maximum benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Where Can I Get This Stuff?</strong></p>
<p>You can purchase essential oils online, or at your local health food store. Alternatively, you can purchase whole fruits, herbs, or flowers from your local supermarket or an herbalist/new age shop in your area. </p>
<p>Depending on whether the product is organic or not, you should be able to pick up a tiny jar of essential oil (about 1 fluid ounce of product) for between $2 and $10. Certain essential oils are more expensive than others, of course. </p>
<p>Not all essential oils are created equal, however. According to <a href="http://www.naha.org/what_is_an_essential_oil.htm">Dr. Brian Lawrence</a>, &#8220;For an essential oil to be a true essential oil, it must be isolated by physical means only. The physical methods used are distillation (steam, steam/water and water) or expression (also known as cold pressing, a unique feature for citrus peel oils). There is one other method of oil isolation specific to a very limited number of essential oil plants. This is a maceration/distillation. In the process, the plant material is macerated in warm water to release the enzyme-bound essential oil. Examples of oils produced by maceration are onion, garlic, wintergreen, bitter almond, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The next time you need to manipulate your brain into doing what you’re trying to tell it to, consider using the practice of aromatherapy as a life hack to increase your productivity. Our sense of smell is deeply tied to our memories and to our moods, so having a couple of vials of essential oil on hand can really help to improve brain function and tap into your hidden energy reserves. It may seem kind of new age-y, but tapping into your sense of smell can center you in a way that will really help you to seize the day.</p>

<p>“You are what you eat.” We’ve all heard it a thousand times before. So when my mom showed up at my house over the weekend with a bunch of bananas, I should have known there was a good reason.</p>
<p>“Hey, Mom. What’s with the bananas?”</p>
<p>“Well, kiddo, you told me you had a rough week, and I read somewhere that bananas were good for reducing your stress levels.”</p>
<p>So I ate a couple bananas, and I started to feel better. And that got me wondering&#8230;what other foods are good for lowering your stress levels?</p>
<p>If you’ve stressed out, it can really affect your productivity. In order to stay at your peak, try snacking on some of the following foods.</p>
<p><strong>1. Bananas<br />
</strong><br />
So obviously I had to start with the food that inspired me to write this. Bananas are high in potassium, which aids in the regulation of blood pressure. Lots of other fruits and vegetables contain potassium, but it’s especially high in bananas.</p>
<p>In addition to stress benefits, bananas can also relieve heartburn and keep your blood sugar levels up.</p>
<p><strong>2. Salmon<br />
</strong><br />
Salmon is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which elevates your mood, thereby helping you to better cope with the aftereffects of a really tough day at the office. These fatty acids aid with brain function, meaning that you’ll have the mental acuity to keep your head when everything is going crazy around you.</p>
<p>Flax seeds are also high in omega-3s.</p>
<p><strong>3. Broccoli<br />
</strong><br />
Broccoli contains folic acid. In addition to being essential for pregnant women, folic acid is also very helpful for lowering stress levels and preventing irritability. Other foods rich in folic acid include asparagus and orange juice.</p>
<p><strong>4. Sugar<br />
</strong><br />
And you thought this article was gonna be all about healthy foods. </p>
<p>Foods that are high in sugar cause your body to produce fewer hormones linked to anxiety. When you ingest sugar, your body creates a hormone that counters stress reactions, called glucocorticoid.</p>
<p>So, while you should make sure to only eat sugar in moderation, a small taste of ice cream, cookies, or chocolate can help you to lower your stress levels almost instantly. Just be careful not to overindulge, or else you might just end up in a sugar coma.</p>
<p><strong>5. Black Tea<br />
</strong><br />
One study conducted in England revealed that people who drank 4 cups of black tea per day for at least 6 weeks saw a marked decrease in the amount of cortisol their bodies were producing. Cortisol is a hormone linked to high stress levels, so anything you can do to limit cortisol production will help you to deal with the stumbling blocks that life puts in your way.</p>
<p><strong>6. Whole Grains<br />
</strong><br />
A diet rich in complex carbs and whole grains encourages your body to produce increased levels of serotonin, a feel-good hormone that improves your mood and produces a sensation of relaxation. </p>
<p><strong>7. Chicken Breast<br />
</strong>Everyone knows tryptophan as a buzzword you hear a lot around Thanksgiving. But believe it or not, chicken breast actually contains a higher level of tryptophan than turkey. That means eating some chicken after a particularly stressful day can help you to get more restful sleep, a very useful benefit if you often find yourself tossing and turning when you have a lot on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br />
</strong><br />
According to nurse <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=55897">Elaine Magee</a>, the way we eat can absolutely affect your mood and our ability to cope with stress. By eating the right combination of foods, we can trick our bodies and brains so that they can battle stress more effectively.</p>
<p>“Amino acids are the building blocks of protein, so you might think that foods high in protein would increase levels of tryptophan, but the opposite is true. Tryptophan has to fight with other amino acids to cross the blood-brain barrier and get into the brain. Since tryptophan is the weaker of the amino acids, generally only a small amount makes it into the brain when other amino acids are present.</p>
<p>But, when you eat a meal that&#8217;s almost all carbs, this triggers insulin to clear the other amino acids from your bloodstream. That leaves tryptophan with a smooth passage into the brain. This, in turn, boosts the serotonin level in the brain. High serotonin levels help boost your mood and help you feel calm.”</p>
<p>As a bonus, when your stress levels are lower thanks to a better diet, you won’t be a victim of “stress eating”. In addition, lower stress means lower levels of cortisol in your body; lower levels of cortisol will make it easier for you to lose weight, particularly around your gut. Those two factors combined mean that you’re more likely to lose weight by following these eating tips. Who knew eating sensibly could make you feel so good?</p><div class="feedflare">

If you have indeed left things to the last minute, resist the urge to pick out your Valentine&#8217;s Day gift at CVS or Walgreens.  You&#8217;ll thank me later.  Instead, look over this list of gift ideas that you could give your loved one this February 14th.  They don&#8217;t take much time to purchase or plan, but still make it look like you actually gave it at least some forethought.</p>
<h2>For the Technology Lover</h2>
<p><strong><em>Microsoft Zune + Zune Pass</em></strong></p>
<p>If your loved one doesn&#8217;t yet have a portable music player, or is in need of an upgrade, this is a perfect gift.  Instead of going for the now somewhat clichéd engraved iPod, I recommend looking to Apple&#8217;s rival, Microsoft, and their Zune player.  While the Zune initially failed to impress the masses as the Apple iPod has, it&#8217;s grown up and matured and become a very quality device as Microsoft has paid more attention to fine-tuning things and making it a better experience.  The Zune Marketplace, Microsoft&#8217;s equivalent of iTunes, is pretty cool.  If you really want to go all out, pair your new Zune purchase with 12-month Zune Pass.  This will allow the recipient to have access to pretty much all the music the Zune Marketplace offers on rental basis.  While you don&#8217;t get to keep all of the music, you do get 10 downloads per month included with the Zune pass, and these are yours to keep.  The Zune will run you anywhere from $120 to $300+, depending on the model and storage options you choose. The 12-month Zune Pass will run you $150. Customize your purchase and choose your recipient&#8217;s favorite color, or pick out a nice cover or case to go along with it, and if you have time install the Zune software on their computer and start downloading all the sappy love songs you want to pre-load for their immediate listening pleasure.</p>
<h2>For the Movie Lover</h2>
<p><strong><em>Netflix  Subscription</em></strong></p>
<p>A subscription to Netflix will allow you to watch an unlimited number of movies and television shows on your TV using a Netflix-enabled device (such as Google TV, Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Roku, Apple TV, etc.).  You can also watch them on any computer, your phone (with a Netflix app), and other mobile internet devices.  If you pay a little extra, you can also get the standard Netflix by mail service and get DVDs and Blu-Ray discs mailed to your home.  You can purchase a Netflix subscription online for a minimum of 3 months or more, and have the option of e-mailing your gift subscription or printing out a certificate.  I&#8217;d recommend printing out the certificate and including it in a nice card.  It starts at about $8.99 per month. If your recipient does not have a Netflix enabled device, pairing the Netflix subscription with one would be even nicer.  Your cheapest option would be a Roku device, which starts at just $59.  Best Buy has you covered.</p>

<p><strong><em>Gourmet Station</em></strong></p>
<p>Scoring dinner reservations at that ultra cool restaurant you&#8217;ve always wanted to try, but haven&#8217;t gotten around to checking out might be a bit tricky on Valentine&#8217;s Day.  Restaurants are notoriously packed on February 14th, and even take-out can be a painful ordeal.  Instead of promising to take your love out for a nice meal at another less busy time, point your web browser to www.gourmetstation.com.  Had you thought about Valentine&#8217;s Day in advance you could have ordered an awesome meal and prepared it on the actual holiday, but you did not so your option at this point is to purchase one for the future.  You could select the meal yourself, but why not just purchase a certificate and let your partner decide what they&#8217;d like to order.  They&#8217;ll have fun visiting the website and selecting a delectable meal.</p>
<p>I actually got the classic beef wellington Christmas dinner from Gourmet Station a couple years ago and was extremely impressed.  The beef wellington was to die for, and the tomato bisque soup was heavenly. The dessert put the meal over the top.  They really make amazing food, and all you have to do is set the table and pop the food in the oven to warm it up.  You could opt to order a meal from a similar service, but because I&#8217;ve tried Gourmet Station in the past, I highly recommend them.</p>
<h2>For the Sports Fan</h2>
<p><strong><em>Opening Day Tickets</em></strong></p>
<p>Baseball season is just around the corner and Spring Training is about to kick off.  Delight the sports fan in your life with tickets to opening day.  To acquire the tickets, just head out to your team&#8217;s local team shop, usually at a mall or near the ballpark.  They&#8217;ll print them out for you, and all you have to do is pick up a V-Day card to put them in.  If you want to give your gift a little extra punch, you could purchase a new t-shirt, hat, or jacket to pair with the tickets.</p>
<h2>For the Romantic</h2>
<p><strong><em>The Old Stand-Bys</em></strong></p>
<p>If your lover is the romantic type, you can pull off the chocolates and flowers. Please though, skip the drug store and at least go to the grocery store where you can likely find something a little higher quality than Whitman&#8217;s.  Make them swoon even more with a nice poem or a heart-felt message written in your carefully selected card. Later, hit up Redbox to pick out a romantic comedy and order in Chinese and you&#8217;ll be set for the evening. Guys, if you&#8217;re not yet married or engaged and want to pop the question, doing it in a romantic way could get you out of getting a gift that day entirely.  You&#8217;ll just have to promise to take her ring shopping.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>Almost everyone who is interested in life hacks has come across the concept of minimalism at some point. Living with less means you have less clutter in your life, which always helps with productivity. One subset of the minimalist movement is 100-item Minimalism, where people make a commitment to live with 100 items or less in their homes. </p>
<p>But a lot of detractors of the 100-item minimalist lifestyle say that living this way is really impractical, even if it has productivity benefits. For example, if you subscribe to 100-item minimalism, then how do you adequately prepare for an emergency scenario? How do you make room in your life for the items that could save you in the event of a hurricane, natural disaster, or terrorist attack? </p>
<p>For apartment dwellers, this need to minimize possessions is especially key. If you have a studio, you probably barely have enough storage space as it is&#8230;but making room for emergency supplies is tough! </p>
<p><strong>Emergency Preparedness and Minimalism Are Two Sides of the Same Coin<br />
</strong><br />
At least, according to the woman who runs <a href="http://apartmentprepper.com/?p=982">ApartmentPrepper.com</a>, a wife and mother who became interested in blogging about emergency preparedness after Hurricane Ike hit her home city of Houston. She argues:</p>
<p>“If you think about it, preparedness and minimalism can actually go hand in hand&#8230;Cutting down on so much material possessions and focusing on the minimum items that are truly necessary to live is the first step to being a minimalist.  Emergency items, to a prepper, falls under the “needs” category&#8230;With preparedness items, you can be selective with what kinds of gadgets do you really need. The rewarding part will come, as we find newly freed space for the stored food and water, which we do need.”</p>
<p>The team at <a href="http://www.survivalbackpacker.com/can-you-be-a-minimalist-survivalist-where-minimalism-frugality-and-preparedness-collide/">SurvivalBackpacker.com</a> agrees. </p>
<p>“Survivalism and minimalism share common roots insofar as they’re both conducive to flexibility and adaptation.  In an emergency situation, you need to be able to adapt quickly.  And having less “stuff” to deal with (in your home as well as in your head) helps,” one post explains. “But so much of preparedness is often about stockpiling goods and food – in addition to the extra equipment and gear so often needed for being able to live outdoors.  How do we reconcile being prepared with living minimally?”</p>
<p>“Authentic survival is already minimalist in its own way.  If it’s just you and your backpack, you will want to keep your items as lightweight and as few as possible&#8230;In sum, at first it seems as though preparedness is at odds with living sustainably and minimally, until you look at the common needs and assumptions of each lifestyle.  Stockpiling foods is a symptom of the consumerist lifestyle of excess most of us are used to living.  Authentic survival skills allow you to live closer to the land – it’s really not a cliche – and in so doing, you’ll be more green and minimalist than you probably expected.”</p>
<p><strong>Small Scale Preparedness<br />
</strong><br />
If you want to be prepared for a disaster, but still use a minimal amount of space, you might want to consider having a small kit you can store in your car or even in your purse. For example, <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/tools/a396/">Think Geek</a> sells an emergency first aid kit that fits inside a sardine can. </p>
<p>It’s waterproof, compact (4.25&#8243; x 3&#8243; x .9&#8243;), impact resistant, and even floats in water. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&#038;productId=202218032&#038;langId=-1&#038;catalogId=10053&#038;ci_src=14110944&#038;ci_sku=202218032&#038;cm_mmc=shopping-_-googlebase-_-D25X-_-202218032&#038;locStoreNum=8931">Home Depot</a> also offers some basic emergency preparedness supplies that are compact and well-suited to any minimalist’s home. </p>
<p>The Ready America Grab &#8216;n Go Kit 2-Person Backpack contains food and water that will sustain two people for about three days. The seven pound backpack is only about 13 inches tall, and also contains a 33-piece first aid kit, ponchos, gloves, and face masks. </p>
<p>For under $50, you can be prepared for most minor disasters, without having to sacrifice too much room in your home or apartment. If you are only going to live with 100 items, it makes sense that at least one of those items would be a disaster readiness kit. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br />
</strong><br />
The more prepared you are now, the less time and energy you will waste later if you have to run around and purchase disaster supplies at the last minute. From either a productivity, minimalist, or emergency preparedness standpoint, it makes sense to be ready to face any curve balls that life may throw at you. </p><div class="feedflare">

I like new toys and am not tied to any specific company; the one with the coolest or best features is the one that wins me over.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my iPad was stolen less than a month after I bought it.  Insurance covered the loss, but I did not rush out to buy a new one right away.  I got my chance to play with the iPad and while it was pretty cool, I found it to be more of an entertainment device than anything and it was lacking some key features &#8211; for example, a camera.  Apple will probably add some of those features with the upcoming release of the iPad 2, which some say is to be announced this week, but I&#8217;m sick of their game of intentionally leaving out features that consumers want and introducing it on a subsequent version so you&#8217;ll buy their product again. I want all the features I want right now.  Sure, I&#8217;ll probably buy another similar device in a year or two, but by that point I expected the features to once again be something new and cutting edge, not a feature that you opted not to include but most others did.</p>
<p>I am still in the market for a new tablet, and it&#8217;s a great time to be ready to acquire one.  The 2011 Consumer Electronics Show last month was dominated by a slew of tablets, the new must-have device.  Tablet computers have been around for some time, but they were never as sleek, pretty, functional, and in-demand as they are now.  The launch of the iPad last year can be credited with bringing the tablet mainstream, but one year later you&#8217;ve got a whole lot more choice.</p>
<p>The top competitor for the Apple iPad right now is any one of a number of Google Android-powered devices manufactured by the likes, of Motorola, Samsung, Dell and others.  HP Palm announced a new webOS powered tablet yesterday, but I think they still be a minor player in the -tablet arena.  I&#8217;ve done my research and played with a few of the new Android tablets and at this point have decided that an Android tablet is a better choice than the iPad.  Here are my top five reasons to choose an Android tablet over an iPad:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<div id="attachment_13454" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 354px"><strong><a href="http://www.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2011/02/dellstreak7.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-13454 " title="dellstreak7" src="http://www.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2011/02/dellstreak7.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="251" /></a></strong><p class="wp-caption-text">Dell Streak 7. Photo courtesy of Dell.</p></div>
<p><strong>1. Choice of Size</strong></p>
<p>The Apple iPad is closest in size to a 10&#215;8 picture frame with its dimensions at 9.56 x 7.47 x .5 in.  There are no other size options for the iPad, unless you&#8217;re of the opinion that the iPad is merely a giant iPhone, and in that case the iPhone could count as a smaller version.</p>
<p>Unlike the iPad, the various Android tablets come in a range of sizes.  The sizes include 5-in. (Dell, Acer), 7-in. (Dell, Samsung, Acer), 9-in. (LG, Panidigital), and 10-in. (Motorola Xoom, Acer) tablets.  The 5-inch tablets are admittedly just slightly larger than popular touchscreen smartphones, which tend to top out in the 4-inch range. But if they make them, there&#8217;s obviously some kind of market for them. You can go bigger or smaller than the iPad with an Android. Personally, I&#8217;d like to go bigger and would love to see an 11-inch tablet come out in the near future.  It&#8217;d be the exact size of a piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>2. True Multitasking</strong></p>
<p>Apple has avoided true multitasking on the iPad primarily due to battery life and performance concerns, the reason they always leave off features on their new iPhones as well.</p>
<p>There are already some Android tablets running off dual-core processors, which have more than enough power to handle true multitasking.  Android 3.0&#8242;s new multitasking panel is also easy to bring up with a single tap on the screen, and provides full previews of running applications.  The multitasking panel is also extremely easy to navigate.</p>
<p>Apple should have figured out how to deliver true multitasking.  Perhaps this will be a feature included in the second-generation iPad.</p>
<p><strong>3. Cameras</strong></p>
<p>Apple made a huge mistake in not including a camera on the iPad.  At the very least it should have included and outward facing camera, but if it really wanted to be a winner, it would have also had a second, front-facing camera that users could use for video chatting.</p>
<p>Most Android tablets have 2 cameras, an outward facing one and a inward one for video chatting.  Google&#8217;s native camera app also has some nice features that will let you alter your image, without having to download and edit it on your computer.</p>

<p><strong>4. No Syncing Required</strong></p>
<p>Whether you own an iPod, iPhone, or an iPad, you must sync the device with iTunes using a computer to transfer downloads purchased on your computer to the device.  It&#8217;s a royal pain, but it&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s way of keeping their users coming back to iTunes.  It&#8217;s also a very slow process.</p>
<p>With the Android Market Web Store, you can buy apps on your computer and send them to your device without syncing. Brilliant!</p>
<p><strong>5. Replaceable Batteries</strong></p>
<p>One of the things that irked me most about the iPhone and the iPad was the battery.  It&#8217;s not removable, and if it goes, you have to get a whole new device.  If yours breaks and still happens to be under warranty, Apple will send you a new one &#8212; for a fee.  For the iPad, if the battery goes, you can send in your old one and they&#8217;ll send you a new one for $99.   Oh, and make sure you synced it before it died because when they send you out the new one it won&#8217;t have any of your apps or personal information on it.  If you forgot to sync, you&#8217;re S.O.L.</p>
<p>Android devices have their own batteries which are replaceable.  If the battery goes, you just buy a new one.  Or if you&#8217;re under warranty, the manufacturer can send you a new one without having to bother with taking your entire tablet.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>Everybody wants an assistant. Not only is a mark of status and rank, but it’s essential for any working professional who has any management responsibilities whatsoever. But what the economy being what it is, the number of people who can afford assistants are few and far between.</p>
<p>Increasingly, professionals and entrepreneurs are turning towards virtual assistants to help them manage their workloads. Depending on the service you select, most virtual assistants are able to assist you with tasks as varied as tracking your expenses, ordering your lunch, or assisting with your PR needs&#8230;and almost all charge rates that are a mere fraction of what you would pay an on-site assistant.</p>
<p>But how effective are virtual personal assistants? And how much can they really boost your productivity (or your bottom line)? Like with any business practice, there are pros and cons. So, are virtual assistants worth it? Here’s how it breaks down&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Pro: Low cost.</p>
<p>Con: You get what you pay for.</strong></p>
<p>The great thing about virtual personal assistants is that many companies offering these services have workers based overseas, meaning that the prices they charge for a full day of work are equivalent to what you drop at Starbucks on your way to the office each morning. Obviously the prices will vary based on location and services rendered, but some workers will help you with your workload for as little as $1-$3 per hour. </p>
<p>That being said, you get what you pay for. So, while you might not be shelling out big bucks to your VPA, you will have to put up with lost-in-translation issues, foreign holidays, and occasional breakdowns in communication.</p>
<p><strong>Pro: The work gets done in your sleep.</p>
<p>Con: Staying in contact can be tricky. </strong></p>
<p>It’s really hard to communicate effectively with someone who works three time zones away from you, let alone eight or twelve time zones away. If you’re working with a team of VPAs, this is less of an issue, but it can still take a bit of getting used to.</p>
<p>All that being said, there’s nothing quite like writing up a to-do list at the end of the day, emailing it off, and coming in the next morning to find everything has been taken care of in your sleep. </p>
<p><strong>Pro: Free trial periods are fairly common.</p>
<p>Con: Fees and quality can vary widely by company/person. </strong></p>
<p>Services like <a href="http://sidsavara.com/personal-productivity/can-virtual-assistants-make-you-more-productive-an-experiment">TimeSvr</a> will offer you a free trial period to assess the quality and fit of their services. That’s great for people who are on the fence about whether they can really benefit from a virtual personal assistant. </p>
<p>That being said, you need to make sure you’ve budgeted accordingly. For example, ihabilis.com charges a base rate of $10 for five tasks, but charges up to $1,000 for 160 hours of work a month. </p>
<p><strong>Pro: Some services offer you an entire team of assistants.</p>
<p>Con: It’s hard to track who’s accountable for your needs at any given time.</strong></p>
<p>You basically have two options to consider when selecting what virtual personal assistant is best suited to your individual needs. You can put all your eggs in one basket and throw in with a single assistant, or you can work with a service that puts several people at your disposal, such as GetFriday. You generally have one person who is your “primary”, along with 2 or three other secondary assistants that are available during off-peak hours.</p>
<p>But while having a team available to you 24 hours a day sounds great, it can be a little confusing knowing who has been assigned to which task in the event that you have last-minute changes to make to your instructions. </p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts<br />
</strong><br />
So, there are a lot of things to consider when selecting a virtual personal assistant. Ultimately, you are the only one who can decide if this kind of service is worth it. If you would like to do some further reading, you might want to check out some other reviews. For example, the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704198004575310710174207000.html">Wall Street Journal</a> has a detailed chart that breaks down the price and features of four popular virtual assistant companies, including GetFriday.com and RedButler.com</p>
<p>If any of you lovely readers has an opinion about virtual personal assistants, or has a past experience with one of these services that they&#8217;d like to share in the comments below, please share with the rest of us! I&#8217;m curious to hear what you all think about the perks and pains of virtual assistants.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>Unless you&#8217;ve got an unlimited amount of cash and a limitless line of credit, saving money is probably something that you could benefit from.  There are countless ways to save money, from coupon clipping to budgeting and shopping at discount stores, but did you know that your Android smartphone could help?  I&#8217;ve waded through the thousands of apps available in the Android Marketplace, and these are some of the best apps out there to help with your money saving goals.</p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mint">Mint.com Personal Finance</a></strong></p>

<p>Google Shopper is another handy tool to use when you&#8217;re out shopping.  The app can recognize products by photo, barcode scanning, and voice and text search.  Once the app has identified the product, you can find local and online prices, reviews, specs. and more.  While you&#8217;re not likely to use it to check the price of your apple juice at the grocery store, it can be handy for larger purchases or for items you may not be at all familiar with.  You&#8217;ll know whether you&#8217;re getting a good deal or if you can get that item cheaper elsewhere, and can star your favorites and share them with friends.  It&#8217;s worth noting that at this time Google Shopper is valid only for US and UK prices.</p>
<p><strong>5. <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.biggu.shopsavvy">ShopSavvy 4 Barcode Scanner</a></strong></p>
<p>Cost: FREE</p>
<p>This is similar to Google Shopper, but it was around first and thus deserves a mention.  The ShopSavvy 4 app is the upgraded version of the old GoCart app.  It allows you to use your phone as a barcode scanner, and then ShopSavvy will provide you with a list of online and local prices for that product. If you don&#8217;t need all the frills of Google Shopper, this is a nice simple barcode program that will help you save money.</p>

<p>Craigslist itself is a great place to score deals on everything from cars to baby clothes.  It&#8217;s the modern-day equivalent of classified ads, and as we all know the good deals get snapped up pretty quickly so you really have to be vigiliant about checking the site if there&#8217;s something specific that you&#8217;re looking for.  Craigslist Notification is a god-send. It notifies you when new stuff is posted in certain categories, so you can monitor the site on the go.</p>

<p>Untold hours of productivity are lost every month due to simple misunderstandings and communication breakdowns. For some reason, many people seem to have a tough time organizing their thoughts and communicating their desires to their co-workers and employees.</p>
<p>I’m constantly amazed at the number of people who seem to have forgotten the basics of composing a written thought. Even some college grads have no grasp on how to speak/write in a way that moves a project forward. </p>
<p>If you are looking for a way to increase productivity and decrease stress, learning to communicate effectively can be the first step towards smoother workflows, faster turnaround times, and fatter bottom lines. Here are a handful of tips that will get you started.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use clear, concise sentences.<br />
</strong><br />
Your goal, whether speaking aloud or composing an email, should be to make yourself instantly and completely understood. To that end, you should avoid using big words, steer clear of run-on sentences, and avoid any unclear phrasing.</p>
<p>You don’t need to use fancy vocab, Latin phrases, corporate buzzwords, or business acronyms to impress your colleagues&#8230;and nine times out of ten, using words like that won’t make you any friends. If a smaller, shorter word will do, then by all means, use that instead of whatever $5 word you just looked up in your thesaurus. </p>
<p>Avoid long sentences with multiple clauses and herds of commas. The longer a sentence is, the more confusing it becomes. Always keep that in mind when writing directions or project details for a colleague. </p>
<p>And for the love of God, make sure your phrasing is clear. There’s nothing worse than getting an email from a co-worker that’s so vaguely worded you have no idea what you’re supposed to do with it. If you aren&#8217;t sure that an email is clearly worded, step away from your computer for five minutes, and then look it over with a fresh perspective.</p>
<p><strong>2. Keep a written record<br />
</strong><br />
Sometimes communicating effectively involves reminding people of what they’ve already told you, and when. Having a written record of all conversations related to a current or past account can be very helpful. </p>
<p>This is easy with email: just make sure never to delete old emails, and use filters for effortless organization. For meetings/calls, make sure you keep clean, easy to read notes that also include the time and date. Audio recording is also an option.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make every comment actionable<br />
</strong><br />
Inevitably, there is a time in every person’s career where they get together with a group of colleagues to discuss a project or proposal, and give feedback as a group. It’s important that when you give feedback on a project, you give actionable directions&#8230;particularly you are at the top of the foodchain. Otherwise, the project can stagnate and people on your team can lose momentum.</p>
<p>It’s the difference between </p>
<p><em>“Someone needs to speak with our design team about using a new font.”<br />
</em><br />
and</p>
<p><em>“Marcy, could you touch base with Jim in Design about our font preferences?”<br />
</em><br />
This ties in with my next point&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>4. Make all criticism constructive<br />
</strong><br />
“Constructive criticism” is one of those feel-good buzzwords we learn to loathe after high school English class. Nevertheless, learning to give helpful feedback to a colleague will not only improve your interpersonal relations, but also will help to improve the quality of your work. </p>
<p>Constructive criticism is more than just a nicer way of talking to people. By giving clear, focused feedback instead of vague, general notes, people you speak with can really learn to improve their methods and practices in the future.</p>
<p>It’s the difference between:</p>
<p><em>“This website is a disgrace.”<br />
</em><br />
and</p>
<p><em>“I see a number of issues here, including the dark green background that makes the text hard to read, and punctuation issues in the first two paragraphs.”</em></p>
<p><strong>5. Make sure you’re using the right word<br />
</strong><br />
Take a moment and review <a href="http://wsuonline.weber.edu/wrh/words.htm">this list</a> of commonly misused words and phrases. </p>
<p>See anything on there that relates to you? If so, you’re not alone. </p>
<p>So consider this: if you’ve been using the wrong words in your personal and business communications, how can you expect anyone to know what you really want? Spell check, grammar check, and the dictionary are your friends. </p>
<p>When in doubt, use them. If you aren’t in doubt, use them anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br />
</strong><br />
Communication can be daunting. Many people are afraid of public speaking, for example, showing a link between fear of speech and ineffective communication. However, if you make a conscious effort to put some of these basic principles into practice, I’m sure you will see results very quickly. </p>
<p>So the next time you are crafting an email or preparing for a status meeting with your team, make sure that you are doing your utmost to communicate clearly and effectively. When everyone can understand what you are trying to say, you will find that your working life goes a lot more smoothly.</p><div class="feedflare">

I already do that. Doesn’t everbody?”</em> And others of you are going, <em>“Ewww, I’d rather die! It’s overwhelming! It’s boring!”</em></p>
<p>For those of you who already have the good habit of corralling and processing paper daily, keep up the good work! Being conscious of the daily flow of paper and deliberately controlling its flow is the only way to win the war on paper.</p>
<p>A casual approach to paper is a guarantee that you’ll create your own personal paper nightmare. Paper is relentless in its flow into your space. You need to be relentless in your handling of it. Do it daily! It really only takes minutes! Minutes of agony or boredom are better than the hours and hours of excavation that will be required if you procrastinate and let paper accumulate.</p>
<p>Here’s what I mean by <strong>PROCESS PAPER DAILY</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Make sure paper follows a specific route, a paper path.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paper should not float from room to room. When paper comes into the house, make sure it lands in one spot to be sorted into categories instead of allowing it to land in any one of a number of different locations. If you decide the kitchen counter is that spot, make sure everyone in your family knows that mail always lands on the kitchen counter.</li>
<li>After being sorted, make sure the different categories of paper are immediately moved to their next logical location. Bills, for example, would go to the bill paying area. Once the bills are paid, the paper associated with them would then be filed or pitched. So, the paper path for a bill would be: from the mailbox to the kitchen counter; from the kitchen counter to the desk of the home office where the bill is paid; from the desk to the filing cabinet. It’s important to create paper paths for every category of paper you regularly handle.</li>
<li>To simplify this process, consider having all paper move from its sorting location to a home office where the different categories can be processed and stored if necessary. That way the path would be: from the mailbox to the kitchen counter for sorting; from the kitchen counter to the home office desktop for review and action; from the the desktop to the filing cabinet or the recycle bin.</li>
<li>Making papers follow specific paths puts you in charge of paper instead of feeling at the mercy of paper. Your work is to determine the paths and to discipline yourself to make paper follow those paths every time. Just one lapse in maintaining your new paper system can cause paper to spiral out of control. Remember, digging out takes much more time and energy than maintaining paper paths! It will take over if you let it stray from a defined route.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sort incoming papers into categories.</strong> I recommend these categories: <strong>trash</strong>; <strong>refer out</strong> to someone else; <strong>action</strong>; <strong>filing</strong>; <strong>reading</strong>; <strong>holding</strong> for later reference or action; and <strong>possibilities</strong> of things to do, buy, etc. It&#8217;s best to separate the action category into bills and other actions. That way you are less likely to lose sight of your bills.</p>
<p><strong>Distribute papers by category to their appropriate locations.</strong> For example, trash goes to the recycling bin or trash can. Action papers are moved to the desk or countertop where action will take place. Filing is either filed or stored in a filing tray until you make time to file. Reading is taken to the location where you do your reading, perhaps a basket on your desk or next to the sofa.</p>
<p>You’ll notice I don’t recommend that you complete all the tasks associated with those papers on a daily basis. That would take more time than you have every day. I am just recommending that you control the flow of paper coming in, sort it and distribute it to the place where it will be acted upon or stored. If you do that much paper processing every day, you will find your stress goes down and your productivity goes up. You&#8217;ll be in charge of paper instead of feeling at the mercy of it!</p>

<p><strong>Parenting 101</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday at lunch, I had a fascinating conversation with my business partners Mikey and Johnny about parenting. Mikey has two kids (ages one and three), as does Johnny (seven and ten) and we discussed the merits and pitfalls of the various parenting styles. Of course we covered over-protective parents who don’t allow their kids to… well, be kids. We talked about parents who seem to hand their insecurities, fears and issues down to their off-spring. And parents who micro-manage every moment of their child’s day. We also spoke about kids playing team sports where no scores are kept during the game because the grown-ups don’t want any of the kids to experience losing.</p>
<p>Good grief.</p>
<p><strong>My Childhood</strong></p>
<p>Growing up in a country town, I spent countless hours with my mates riding our bikes (without helmets) through dense leach-infested bush. In the middle of the wilderness, we would make fires, build ramps and jumps for our bikes, ride down stupidly steep hills, catch frogs and other critters, wade in swamps and often get lost. When we weren’t exploring the wilds of Latrobe Valley, we were playing team games and sports where there would be actual winners and losers. Amazingly, nobody died from losing a game of football, playing in dirt, climbing a tree or coming last in a running race.</p>
<p>And I should know; I came last many times.</p>
<p>So, clearly the bloke with no kids is not the guy to turn to for parenting advice but as a casual observer, can I respectfully suggest that perhaps all our parental protection, direction and intervention might (at times) be leaving some of our kids ill-equipped to deal with the messy, nasty, unfair, uncomfortable reality of life beyond the parental bubble? Life post-childhood?</p>
<p>Just saying. </p>
<p><strong>Life Lessons</strong></p>
<p>I worry about kids who never experience any kind of loss. Who never scrape their knees. Who never climb a tree, chase a frog, attack an ant nest, crash their bike or play in dirt. Who never experience the unfairness of life. Who never have to work hard or get uncomfortable. Who never fail anything at school because some grown-up decided that giving marks or grading work could be detrimental to the child’s self-esteem. Again, good grief. Wait till that child enters the workforce and their first boss is a total prick.</p>
<p>Let’s see mum and dad fix that.</p>
<p>But then again, maybe the non-parent is missing the point? What would I know? The only thing I’ve ever raised is a Golden Retriever. And he had issues. Which is why I need your help today. Feel free to answer one, all or some of the following questions. Don’t be shy. Participation makes this a worthwhile exercise. I will give away five signed copies of my new book for the contributions that blow my lace-up Ugg boots off. Yes, we will post books anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Here are my conversation starters:</p>
<ol>
<li>Am I vaguely in the ball park with this topic or am I totally missing the point?</li>
<li>Are we adequately preparing our kids for life beyond childhood?</li>
<li>When does protecting, guiding and encouraging a child go from being a positive to a negative?</li>
<li>What are the signs, symptoms and consequences of an over-protective parent?</li>
<li>Do we tell our over-protective, neurotic, control-freak friends what they’re doing or do we stay out of it?</li>
<li>Your general thoughts on the matter?</li>
</ol>

<p>Like lawyers and dentists, few people actually enjoy having to deal with car salesmen.  They&#8217;re a necessary evil that often leave consumers with a bad taste in their mouths because of the tactics they employ to get people to purchase a new vehicle.  Coming out of the negotiations with a new car and a great deal on it can happen, if you go about things the right way.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Financing Ahead of Time</strong></p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve decided that it is time to buy new vehicle, instead of heading straight out to the dealership, visit your local credit union or bank and secure financing in advance.  Car dealers make a lot of their profit on financing deals, and you can save a lot of money by getting your auto loan through a reputable third-party ahead of time.  Once you&#8217;ve done this, you&#8217;re ready to head out to the dealership and take a look at the vehicles, although it is a good idea to do some research in advance and figure out which ones you might be interested in.</p>
<p><strong>Go In Well-Rested</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure you&#8217;re well-rested on the day that you go to pick out your new car.  Don&#8217;t go when you&#8217;re rushed or overtired, or after a long day at work.  You need to be 100% there mentally if you want to come out of it with the best deal possible.</p>
<p><strong>Ask to See the Invoice</strong></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve found the car you&#8217;d like to purchase and the dealer takes you into his office or cubicle to begin the wheeling and dealing, ask to see the invoice.  This will tell you all kinds of information about the car, but most importantly, how much the dealership paid for it.  Keep that figure in mind as you negotiate what you&#8217;re willing to pay.  Sure, they&#8217;re going to make a profit, but knowing that number can help you lead negotiations in the direction of minimizing their profit and lowering your overall cost.</p>
<p><strong>Just Say &#8220;NO&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>The first thing that you need to know when it comes to negotiating the price of the vehicle you&#8217;re interested in purchasing is that &#8220;NO&#8221; is your best weapon.  Arm yourself and be prepared to use it, possibly even multiple times. Don&#8217;t let them strong-arm you or sweet talk you into something that you would not be comfortable with. Take a cue from my 18-month-old toddler and say it like you mean it (head shake optional).</p>
<p><strong>Let Them Come at You With an Offer</strong></p>
<p>The dealer will ask you some basic information about yourself, such as your name, address, and so on.  Answer honestly.  Most will start off the price negotiations by asking you how much you&#8217;d like to pay per month.  An appropriate answer to this question that will throw them off their game is &#8220;I&#8217;d like to pay zero.&#8221;  You might get a chuckle or a &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t we all&#8221; type comment before the salesman resumes his attempts to get you to provide him with a magic number that you&#8217;d be willing to pay them each month for the privledge of driving the vehicle of your choice.  They might ask you what you are paying now.  If your car is paid off, answer &#8220;Zero.&#8221;  If you are still making payments, give them an honest answer. Do not make the mistake of giving them a price you&#8217;d be willing to pay each month.</p>
<p>For your best chances at scoring a good deal, make them come at you with an offer.  No salesman would tell you that the amount per month you&#8217;re willing to pay is a lot higher than the deal that you could possible walk away with.  Car salesman get a minimal salary for hanging out at the dealership, but can make their riches in the commission they earn by selling cars. Their goal is to maximize their commission and the profit for the dealership. Your goal is to minimize their commission and the profit they make to get the best deal on your new vehicle. Get them to give you a number, and when they do, it&#8217;s time to begin negotiating.</p>

<strong>Bring an Extra Set of Keys</strong></p>
<p>If you will be trading in a vehicle to help offset the cost of the new one, don&#8217;t leave home without taking two sets of keys with you.  One tactic that dealers try to employ during the negotiations process is to look at your car and then kidnap your keys.  If you bring along second key they can&#8217;t hold you hostage.  Just make sure to give them the key that is a cheap copy, not one with a fancy key-fob or remote.  The idea is, if negotiations go sour and they try to hold you captive while hanging on to your keys, you can walk right out the door without having to worry about getting the key back.  They&#8217;re not expecting this, and will chase after you with promises of a better deal.</p>
<p><strong>Inform the Salesman That You Already Have Financing &amp; Finalizing the Deal</strong></p>
<p>Do not, I repeat, DO NOT inform the salesman in advance that you&#8217;ve already secured financing.  Keep this a closely guarded secret until the time is right.  If they know that you already have financing, it will change the way they deal with you.  The time to make the big reveal is once you&#8217;ve agreed on the final price of the vehicle.  Your credit union loan or other third-party auto financing will likely have better rates and terms than what the dealer is offering. At this point, pull out your calculator and utilize your financing details to figure out how much you&#8217;ll be paying in the end.  More than likely, it will be less than what you would have paid had you used dealer financing.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Follow this advice and I guarantee that you&#8217;ll walk out of the dealership with not only a new car, but also the satisfaction of knowing that you got the best deal you could have gotten. It feels a lot better than getting screwed out of hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>When I’m not writing for Stepcase Lifehack, I spend my time crafting microfiction. I am the author of a 365-part fiction serial running at <a href="http://MargeryJones.com">MargeryJones.com</a>, and I have a piece of microfiction being featured in an upcoming HarperCollins fiction anthology <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thackery-T-Lambshead-Cabinet-Curiosities/dp/0062004751/">on sale</a> this June. </p>
<p>So I know a little something about getting a lot accomplished in a short amount of time. For example, sitting down and creating a novel is intimidating. But by focusing my efforts into writing a daily serial, I’ll have a novella complete by the end of the year with very little time invested per month. Some of the precepts of writing microfiction can easily be applied to any situation to help you reach a major goal or milestone. </p>
<p>I’m not the first person to write about this kind of “micro-productivity”. The <a href="http://www.friendlyanarchist.com/mighty-micro-productivity/">Friendly Anarchist</a> wrote a blog post about making the most of those 5-minute windows of time we all have in our day. He suggests that when you have a spare couple of minutes with nothing to do, you should use it to do something worthwhile, something productive: “Create cool stuff: Edit some photos, skribble some sketches, jot down an outline for your next essay, write a haiku.”</p>
<p>He argues that we sometimes psyche ourselves up when reaching for major goals or blocking out time for creative pursuits. By working in small chunks of time, “your old buddy procrastination has no chance to hit, if all you got are five minutes. And who knows, maybe&#8230;you’ll get an effortless 20 minutes of action, without even having to struggle.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, if you’re interested in accomplishing big projects with just a little bit of effort, here’s the basic process to follow.</p>
<p><strong>1. Set a major goal<br />
</strong><br />
This is the time to dream big. Maybe you want to write a novel, get in shape, or earn some extra income with a side business. Decide what major life goal you have been putting off for years, and make a commitment to make a dent in the work required to make that goal a reality.</p>
<p><strong>2. Break down that goal into micro-tasks<br />
</strong><br />
Say your major goal is to get rock hard abs by the end of the year. You might decide that the way for you to accomplish that goal is to do 100 crunches a day. If you’re committed to writing a novel, break down the work of writing into a set number of pages, chapters, or words.</p>
<p>The important thing isn’t <em>how</em> you break down the work leading towards successful completion of your goal, but rather that you break down the work into small, manageable micro-projects. Think about what you can conceivably get done in a 5 or 10 minute period of time, or what you can do over several such blocks of time without major fits and starts.</p>
<p><strong>3. Set a schedule<br />
</strong><br />
For example, say you’re still planning on working on your abs, and want to do 100 crunches a day. You break down those 100 crunches into 4 groups of 25, making your goal easy to achieve during the commercial breaks of an hour long TV show. </p>
<p>Or maybe you’re dead-set on finishing a novel, so you dedicate three of your coffee breaks at work each week to scribbling a few passages into a notebook. </p>
<p><strong>4. Get ahead of schedule<br />
</strong><br />
How do you do that? Simple. Just make an effort to use any 5-10 minute chunks of free time that you would otherwise “waste” to work on your project. I mentioned working your goals into TV commercial breaks above. Other great places to sneak in a little productive time include your morning commute (assuming you are a carpool passenger or subway rider), or while you’re making dinner (while waiting for water to boil or the microwave to ding).</p>
<p>And when you’re ahead of schedule (which is easy to do when it only takes 5 minutes to make progress), you’ll find that your this boosts your confidence. And when you feel good about your project and your goals, you’ll be more motivated and more productive.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Obviously you shouldn’t use every spare 5-minute chunk of your day towards your goals. Everybody needs a little down time to veg out and recharge their batteries. But by making a conscious effort to spend a few minutes per day working towards a major life goal, you will make slow, measured progress that might not be possible otherwise.</p>
<p>And even if you don’t have a major goal you’re working towards, using several 5-10 minute blocks of time towards a productive goal each day can really do wonders for both your personal and professional life. In an older post here at Lifehack.org, <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/20-productive-ways-to-use-your-free-time.html">Leo Babauta</a> wrote a great list of ways to make productive use of these small chunks of time. Those tips included balancing your checkbook, networking with your professional contacts, or even earning extra money by freelancing on the side.</p>
<p>Big goals are scary. You can easily get derailed working on major projects if you get frustrated or anxious about working on them. Working on a project for 5-10 minutes at a time can keep you from becoming your own worst enemy. And when you aren&#8217;t getting in your own way, you&#8217;ll be amazed at what you can accomplish.</p><div class="feedflare">

<p>If you spend any time at all researching life hacks, you’ve probably heard of the famous Pomodoro Technique. Created in the 1980s by Francesco Cirillo, the Pomodoro Technique is one of the more popular time management life hacks used today. But this method isn’t for everyone, and for every person who is a passionate adherent of the system, there is another person who is critical of the results.</p>
<p>Is the Pomodoro Technique right for you? It’s a matter of personal preference. But if you are curious about the benefits of using the technique, this article will break down the basic information you will need to decide if this technique is worth trying out.</p>
<p><strong>What is it?<br />
</strong><br />
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management philosophy that aims to provide the user with maximum focus and creative freshness, thereby allowing them to complete projects faster with less mental fatigue.</p>
<p>The process is simple. For every project throughout the day, you budget your time into short increments and take breaks periodically. You work for 25 minutes, then take break for five minutes. </p>
<p>Each 25-minute work period is called a “pomodoro”, named after the Italian word for tomato. Francesco Cirillo used a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato as his personal timer, and thus the method’s name.</p>
<p>After four “pomodoros” have passed, (100 minutes of work time with 15 minutes of break time) you then take a 15-20 minute break. </p>
<p>Every time you finish a pomodoro, you mark your progress with an “X”, and note the number of times you had the impulse to procrastinate or switch gears to work on another task for each 25-minute chunk of time. </p>
<p><strong>How can it help you?<br />
</strong><br />
Frequent breaks keep your mind fresh and focused. According to <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/faq.html">the official Pomodoro website</a>, the system is easy to use and you will see results very quickly: “You will probably begin to notice a difference in your work or study process within a day or two. True mastery of the technique takes from seven to twenty days of constant use.”</p>
<p>If you have a large and varied to-do list, using the Pomodoro Technique can help you crank through projects faster by forcing you to adhere to strict timing. Watching the timer wind down can spur you to wrap up your current task more quickly, and spreading a task over two or three pomodoros can keep you from getting frustrated. The constant timing of your activities makes you more accountable for your tasks, and minimizes the time you spend procrastinating. You’ll grow to “respect the tomato”, and that can help you to better handle your workload.</p>
<p><strong>Who loves it?<br />
</strong><br />
Steven Sande of <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2009/11/28/the-pomodoro-technique-or-how-a-tomato-made-me-more-productive/">The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> is a fan of the system, and has compiled a great list of Apple-compatible Pomodoro tools.  Before he started using the technique, he said, “Sometimes I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to organize a single day in my calendar, simply because I would jump around to all sorts of projects and never get even one of them accomplished.”</p>
<p>Another proponent of the Pomodoro Technique is Sue Shellenbarger of the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704538404574541590534797908.html">Wall Street Journal</a>. Shellenbarger tried out this system, along with several other similar methods for time management, and said that “It eased my anxiety over the passing of time and also made me more efficient; refreshed by breaks, for example, I halved the total time required to fact-check a column.”</p>
<p><strong>Criticism<br />
</strong><br />
Despite the number of Pomodoro-heads out there, the system isn’t without its critics.  <a href="http://developeraspirations.wordpress.com/2009/12/16/a-month-of-the-pomodoro-techniquethepositive/">Colin T. Miller</a>, a Yahoo! employee and blogger, tried using the Pomodoro Technique and had some issues. </p>
<p>“Pomodoros are an all or nothing affair,” he says. “Either you work for 25 minutes straight to mark your X or you don’t complete a pomodoro. Since marking that X is the measurable sign of progress, you start to shy away from engaging in an activity if it won’t result in an X. For instance&#8230;meetings get in the way of pomodoros. Say I have a meeting set for 4:30pm. It is currently 4:10pm, meaning I only have 20 minutes between now and the meeting&#8230;In these instances I tend to not start a pomodoro because I won’t have enough time to complete it anyway.”</p>
<p>Another critic is <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/02/pomodoro-critique">Mario Fusco</a>, who argues that the Pomodoro Technique is&#8230;well&#8230;sort of ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Aren&#8217;t we really able to keep ourselves concentrated without a timer ticketing on our desk?&#8230;Have you ever seen a civil engineer using a timer to keep his concentration while working on his projects?&#8230;I think that, like any other serious professional, I can stay concentrated on what I am doing for hours&#8230;Bring back your timer to your kitchen and start working in a more professional and effective way.”</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>One of the best things about the Pomodoro Technique is that it’s free. Yeah, you can fork over some bills to get a tomato-shaped timer if you want&#8230;or you can use any timer program on your computer or phone. So even if you try it and hate it, you haven’t lost any cash.</p>
<p>The process isn’t ideal for every person, or in any line of work. But if you need a systematic way to tackle your daily to-do list, the Pomodoro Technique may fit your needs.</p>

<p>If you are self-employed or own a small business, you know all too well that out-of-control overhead costs can be crippling. Operating costs are a necessary evil&#8211; you need to spend money to make money, after all. But for businesses trying to weather tough economic conditions, or for start-ups just trying to break even, one month with too much overhead can be the kiss of death.</p>
<p>Overhead can include expenses like rent, utilities, office supplies, and advertising. And while all these expenses seem pretty normal, it doesn’t mean they are necessary. If you’re serious about cutting costs without cutting corners, the following tips can help reduce overhead in your business.</p>
<p><strong>1. Go Paperless<br />
</strong><br />
This should be pretty obvious by now, but going paperless is a great way for a business to decrease both clutter and expenditures. You can store important documents in the cloud or on disks, sign all contracts electronically, and help save the environment as an added bonus. </p>
<p>You won’t have to pay for paper or ink cartridges. You can sell your printer on Craigslist. And if you back up all your paper files digitally, you might even be able to downgrade to a smaller (and cheaper) office space, saving even more money each month.</p>
<p><strong>2. Splurge on an Accountant<br />
</strong><br />
It may seem counterintuitive to shell out big bucks for an accountant or tax service professional to do your bookkeeping. After all, these people generally charge a lot of money for their services. But if you have someone at say, H&#038;R Block look over your taxes this April, the company’s policy is to pay any penalties or interest caused by an error on their part. </p>
<p>Best of all, tax and accounting professionals will be more likely to find deductions that you might have overlooked. It’s a big investment, especially for a small business. But it’s an investment worth making. You can’t put a price on peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>3. Evaluate Your Needs<br />
</strong><br />
Look around your office. Now, ask yourself, “What do I see here that I don’t use every day?” </p>
<p>Do you really need business cards in an age where you maintain a web site, a Twitter profile, and a Facebook page? How much are you paying for “premium” web hosting each month? </p>
<p>You shouldn’t be paying for anything you don’t need, whether it’s office equipment, supplies, or space. Which brings me to my next point&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>4. Find the Perfect Space<br />
</strong><br />
Is your office currently in a location that makes good financial sense? Do you need to maintain a downtown storefront, or would you be better served by working from a smaller office?  Do you even need an office/studio space? Could you work from home instead? How often do you need to interact with clients face-to-face?</p>
<p>The answers to those questions will vary depending on your industry, the size of your company, and your financial outlook for 2011. By securing a space that really suits your business, you will likely save time and be more productive.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ditch Your Phone<br />

There’s no reason you need to pay through the nose for phone service. Not in this day and age.</p>
<p>Again, how much you can cut back depends on the size of your company, how many employees you have, and what industry you are in. Between Skype and Google Voice, paying for phone calls and voicemail is a thing of the past, though you may still need to pay some money for international calling. Both services also have mobile apps, meaning you can stay connected on the go.</p>
<p>And if you need a “traditional” land line, consider VOIP over the standard offerings from phone companies in your area.</p>
<p><strong>6. Make Smart Hiring Decisions<br />
</strong><br />
If you have to hire a new employee, hire someone who has multiple strengths. They don’t need to have a degree in Computer Science, but if your new sales rep also knows how to check your TCP/IP settings and craft press releases, that’s a huge plus. Investing in professional development for your employees is another way to keep them happy and promote long-term growth and success for your company.</p>
<p><strong>7. Develop Brand Ambassadors<br />
</strong><br />
Advertising is expensive, and can’t guarantee consistent or impressive results. You might pay a couple hundred dollars to run a TV, radio, or print ad in your area, only to find that you drum up very little business.</p>
<p>A smarter idea is to get your clients to become brand ambassadors. Offer your current clients and customers incentives for talking you up, and for referring new business to you. Word-of-mouth is still a persuasive tool in our digital age, and one that people tend to take for granted. Get satisfied customers to tweet about you for discounted services, or offer current customers free services for every new client they refer to you. </p>
<p><strong>The Bottom Line<br />
</strong><br />
It’s almost impossible to run a business without some overhead. But these operating costs can be minimized or eliminated in many cases, leaving you with more profits in your pockets. A business with streamlined operating expenses will have the best possible chance for success, so make sure you’re running a tight ship.</p><div class="feedflare">
