href="https://formscentral.acrobat.com/"><strong>FormsCentral</strong></a>. It’s an online service for designing, distributing, collecting and analyzing data from HTML forms. You can create several different types of web forms and surveys including registration pages, contact forms, mailing lists and questionnaires. The forms are hosted by Adobe.</p><p><a

When creating the forms you can add text, paragraph, single choice, multiple choice, date, drop-down options, and checkboxes. There are a number of templates available and it’s probably fair to say you won’t be blown away by the basic designs, but you can customize by adding your own images and setting up your own color schemes to beautify and enhance those dull web forms.</p><p>One major feature which is missing however is the ability to embed the form into your own site or blog. It would be nice to have the visitors fill in the form or survey on your own site rather than being brought to a separate page, but this will possibly be addressed in future updates.</p><h5><a

You can look at all the responses as a whole or look at individual replies as a record view. The returned data can be shared amongst colleagues and you can decide who accesses the data and what they can do with it. If you run an online survey you can view all responses in a table format or export the data to XLS, CSV and other formats. You can add additional columns and formulas to your response table to help you analyze your form data.</h5><p>&#160;</p><p>FormsCentral has three pricing levels:</p><ul><li>Free (one online form or survey and get up to 50 responses)</li><li>Basic for $14.00/month (five forms or surveys 500 responses per form)</li><li>Plus for $199/year (unlimited forms or surveys and 5,000 responses per form)</li></ul><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>Have you tried other HTML form building services?

We take the Podcast live to celebrate 100 amazing shows, with a parade of guests from podcasts past. I’m Kevin Yank and this is the SitePoint Podcast #100: Our Live Anniversary Show!</p><p>And welcome everyone to SitePoint Podcast #100 broadcasting live! Wow, this feels so weird guys, we’ve got 41 people in the chat room as I record this, listening along with us, welcome everyone from the chat room and welcome back you guys. Congratulations on #100!</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Congratulations to you guys as well.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> We are up right now on a service called <a
href="http://tinychat.com/">Tinychat</a> which means we can all see each other’s faces for the first time recording a podcast remotely, and yeah we’ve got an audience. We also have a packed schedule of guests, we went back through the archives of the SitePoint Podcast and looked at all of our favorite guests and who we wanted to get on and there were just too darn many, so the reality is rather than get people on that we just had two weeks ago on the show I went right back to the beginning and sort of picked the first 25 episodes and invited just about everyone from that list. So we’ve got a whole bunch of SitePoint old-time podcast guests, many favorites, I don’t think I’ll spoil the surprise just now, but plenty to look forward to. But in the meantime we’ve got a little time to talk about the news, I’m sure you guys have brought some stories, I have too, so who wants to start us off with a news story here?</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Yeah, so there’s a pretty interesting article that was posted by a gentleman by the name of, and I’m sure I’m gonna butcher it like I do with everybody’s name, Byrne Reese, who was a former project manager of MovableType and TypePad and worked at Six Apart for about four years, and the article is essentially titled <a
href="http://www.majordojo.com/2011/02/how-did-wordpress-win.php">How Did WordPress Win?</a>, and it stirred up a lot of conversation because it’s not someone on the WordPress side that wrote this article it’s somebody on the other side of the fence and I think that’s what made it most interesting is he actually went into quite a bit of detail on why he thought that WordPress, it feels that WordPress kind of won the battle if there was a battle between the two blogging platforms, and he points out some different reasons why he thought that WordPress has ultimately won that battle, and I think a lot of people might agree with him. A few of those items were, the biggest one is the licensing issue, in 2004 Movable Type changed up their licensing so you could have a free blog but there were limitations to it, I think you could only have three free blogs with a single author and anything above that cost money, so that immediately turned off a lot of their users and a lot of them went over to WordPress, which at the time was a fairly new blogging platform, I think it had only been around for about a year, maybe a little bit more, so I don’t know, I don’t go that far back in the WordPress community, most people know I’m pretty involved in WordPress, but I got started around 2006 so it was after all the dust had settled from this, but going back and reading some of the articles and some of the people’s different viewpoints, I mean this was definitely a major shift in what people were using for the publishing platform, this is what ultimately gave WordPress that huge boost into the spotlight and it’s just kept growing every since, so it’s an interesting article, did you guys have a chance to read it?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, I did. I was surprised at the bottom to, well, I was wondering the whole way through because I don’t keep that much track of Movable Type at the moment, but all the way through I was kind of in suspense over what this guy’s current state of employment is because at the start of the story he kind of gives a little bracketing, he says, look, back when I used to work at Six Apart you couldn’t really just go and post something that had to do with Movable Type online without running it past the marketing department and this person and that person, but what the heck I’m gonna do it now, which gave the impression that he still worked at Six Apart and he was flaunting the authority of his superiors by posting this. But it turns out he is still in the Moveable Type business, at the bottom he’s working these days for a consulting company that consults primarily on Movable Type, which I found interesting because one of the points that he made in his article was that one of the big missteps he thinks that Six Apart made was acquiring the major Movable Type consulting business out there and bringing it in-house and therefore killing off this ecosystem of support companies, giving the impression that no one was in the Movable Type business. I know that would hurt you, Brad, if for example— well, you know, it might not hurt you if Automattic went and acquired WebDev Studios, but if Automattic were to acquire a major WordPress development house and started offering WordPress ad hoc WordPress development services to anyone that would be tough for you to compete with.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Yeah, I mean definitely. And you certainly wouldn’t want someone from that shop going and publishing an article like this which like you said is kind of interesting, but no you’re right, it would be tough to compete with that, and who’s to say it won’t happen, I have no idea, but it is interesting it went that route. He also works with Melody, I believe that’s how it’s pronounced, which is a fork of Movable Type platform, I don’t know that much about it.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> That’s how WordPress got its start, right; it was a Fork of B2 wasn’t it?</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Right, yeah, it was a fork of B2, and because of that B2 was licensed under the GPL Open Source license, and so WordPress inherited that because it was a fork, so since the beginning WordPress has been Open Source freely available. And then like I said back in 2004 when Movable Type switched their license they were no longer free, and so that caused this big rift in this big migration over to WordPress.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> It’s an interesting story, he has a few choice words for the boffins at Automattic for how they supposedly won this war and the fact that their community is not as positive or fostering of positive discussion about competitors as it could be. We’ve got a guest on a little bit later who is going to talk about WordPress with us and I look forward to chatting with him about this story. But we’ve got a couple of other stories to get through before our first guest, Patrick, what did you bring?</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Well, I brought <a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2011/02/11/facebook-pages-are-changing/">a story about the new Facebook page updates</a> that came online a few days ago. Facebook pages if you are a business or if you have a website, SitePoint has a Facebook page, <a
href="http://www.facebook.com/sitepoint">facebook.com/sitepoint</a>, and it’s really the only main way to promote your business or your website or your non-human identity on Facebook, so Facebook launched a series of changes that are noteworthy and very useful to people who manage pages, and I’ll summarize a few of them here, but one thing you can do now is you can log in as a page so what you can do is you can switch from your personal account to actually being a page and that allows you to interact with other pages as that page, so for example you can go to another page and not comment as Kevin Yank, for example, but comment as SitePoint, that page on this other page you can’t comment on any personal profiles that are not enabled to allow everyone to comment, but it does allow you to better interact with other pages through comments, through liking pages, and gives you a better way of highlighting your other pages, so if you have multiple websites or related products then you could better highlight those now. Another change is that you can notify or have yourself be notified whenever there is a new like or new comments on your page, so now you can be notified of specific mentions or specific posts on your page, not just the summary that you would receive weekly as I receive as some of the managers of our pages I just get an email that says, oh, 47 likes this week, well now you can be notified when that stuff actually happens. Another noteworthy thing is better moderation tools really, like a block list of vulgarity or profanity that you can enable on three different strength levels, and also a block list that you can yourself set to block certain terms from the pages. So that’s just a couple of the main things and there are some articles on SitePoint that will be in the show notes as well that will detail some of these changes.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> Is this just for the administration of pages?</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yep.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> But I notice some things changed too with just the user interface too, like now if you hit the enter key on a comment it leaves the comment, right, so if you wanted to leave a multi-line comment now you have to do shift-return which is kind of annoying to me.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, that’s interesting, I actually noticed that the other day, I don’t know if that’s related to this pages thing, but yeah, it is a little annoying.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> A lot of these features seem geared toward beefing up the pages to turn them more into a full fledged— adding sort of features you’d expect from a full fledged forum community, would you say that’s right Patrick?</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I would say that’s basically more or less right; I think some of these features are things that I really would have really liked to have seen earlier like the block list of words or profanity that you could enable, that’s just kind of I would say not a common sense feature but a feature that does make a lot of sense, and the tools that Facebook allows for moderation right now are really very primitive and not as powerful as one would like to be, not even near forums but just some basic comment moderation where it’s difficult to stop someone from posting this specific term, now at least these tools will help but there still needs to be some changes to the permission system I feel where you can grant people access to manage your page without granting them access to everything, give them the ability to close the page or remove other admins; that’s something really limits my use of Facebook pages where I’d like to have someone else post stories from my site maybe, but I also don’t want to give them the keys to the castle either.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Stephen you’ve got a couple of stories in your list, what’s your favorite?</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> Well, I’ve got this Huffington Post story about <a
href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/10/huffington-post-bloggers_n_821446.html" title="How The Huffington Post Works (In Case You Were Wondering)">what they’re actually doing at the Huffington Post</a> since their AOL acquisition and how it works internally. And I think the way I read the article is they’re kind of admitting to being a content farm— Sorry Patrick! (laughter)</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Why sorry to me?</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> Well, because of the story last week.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Okay, I’m not a content farm. (laughter) Is that what you’re implying?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> He is! He is a content farm! (Laughter) No, I see what you mean, it’s weird, the author of the story kind of says, look, everyone accuses us of being a content farm and not paying our authors, but the truth is that we do pay some of our authors, those that we expect to be at an office and that we expect to be able to take a phone call and send them out to cover a particular story, but we also create this content in order to create this vibrant space that gets a lot of traffic so that people, anyone can come and write a story for us and not get paid for it.</p><p>I actually don’t mind the story, and I can see why people are kind of going “Aha! We accused you of not paying your authors and this is you admitting it.” But I follow his logic which is that if you’re going to write on Huffington Post and you haven’t been invited to do so, you know, you just want to come and contribute a story, that even if they paid people like that 50 bucks to do it I’m not sure what that would achieve; the reasons for people wanting to contribute to Huffington Post usually they’re worth a lot more than 50 bucks and they aren’t necessarily valued in money, people want to participate to build their profile, to build a portfolio of writing, to, I don’t know, just to get themselves out there as writers, and I think that although they might not have the balance quite right I don’t necessarily think not paying people who they don’t necessarily invite to contribute is a problem.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> The people who are causing a fuss about this aren&#8217;t causing a fuss about <a
href="http://www.newsvine.com/">Newsvine</a> which is mostly user contributed stories.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, it’s the same thing, just less successful, right?</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> Exactly, it’s not as big and they still have aggregated content but it’s the same thing on its face. So, it’s kind of funny to me that people aren’t causing a stink about that but they want to go after The Huffington Post over the same thing.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I didn’t read this post at The Huffington Post, so just fair disclosure there, but I have been looking at the stories after the sale regarding people not being paid, and really there are plenty of examples online of communities that are growing, making money, being sold that are largely contributors that do not receive some sort of compensation, but they do receive some benefit; they have some desire to do it or they wouldn’t do it, and I mean I’m totally for looking out for people and making sure that people don’t get taken advantage of, but at the same time people make the decision to write for The Huffington Post or to post in forums or to contribute something online in some way that is on someone else’s website with ads on it, it’s been going on since the beginning of the popular Internet. So to me Huffington Post is not even a bad example of that, it’s an example where you have all these people, these celebrities and different people who go there to get some attention off of The Huffington Post because of their traffic, so I don’t feel there’s anything really wrong being done here.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> And I brought a story as well which has to do with Hashbangs; anyone else been reading about Hashbangs this week?</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> A little bit.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Hash bangs are these new URLs that are in use on sites like twitter.com and also the whole Gawker Media Network that launched its major redesign in the past week. And the idea is that these sites no longer use URLs that go to an actual web page, all of the URLs on these sites just point to the home page and then have a hash, what would you call it, a fragment identifier that contains the whole rest of the URL. And so what the browser does when it gets one of these URLs is it loads the home page of the site you’ve asked for and then a piece of JavaScript in that page runs to actually load the content using Ajax.</p><p>There’s been a lot of talk about how these sites that use these types of URLs are really kind of breaking the Internet, and I kind of have to agree with that perspective, especially since there seems to be no real benefit to using this format of URL over a more robust development methodology. The problem was highlighted when the day that Gawker launched its new site using these types of URLs, a single line of their JavaScript code had a bug in it and it took their entire network of sites down for several hours. For those several hours on their launch day anyone who went to any page on any one of their sites just basically got a blank page because the JavaScript was broken, so this is an argument that I’ve seen people making that if your development methodology leads to a single line of JavaScript taking down not only your homepage, not only your whole site but your entire network of sites, there’s probably something a little wrong with the way you’re doing web development.</p><p>There’s been a couple of good stories about this, I’ll post <a
href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/02/09/Hash-Blecch" title="Broken Links">the best one I found from Tim Bray</a> into the chat room here, but I look forward to talking with one of our guests about Hashbangs, any thoughts from you guys?</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> I mean if there’s no benefit then what’s the point? That’s what baffles me; it seems like this is a big red flag for search engines because the whole point is when you land on your site you don’t want to have a redirect happen in any manner even if it’s behind the scenes with Ajax.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So I guess the only benefit and if I were trying to put myself in their shoes the reason you do this is so that every web page that loads, loads something really quickly, and the cynic in me says maybe that’s an ad, maybe what it loads is a shell of a page and then they have complete control over the order that things are loaded into that page using JavaScript. So the actual HTML that the browser loads initially is super light, comes up super quick and from then their JavaScript takes complete control and they can load the ads first, for example, or if they prefer to optimize for content, which I would hope, they load the content first and then decorate it with the rest of the page; they have more control in that way. But in order to seize that control they really are breaking some parts of the Web.</p><p>You mentioned search engines, Brad, and the way they’re getting around the search engines with this is basically they’ve gotten from Google a concession that Google will recognize these HashBang URLs, these fake URLs, convert them into big, ugly real URLs when it’s indexing the site, so the site that Google indexes is kind of a fake, static version of the site that no one ever sees except Google, and then when Google delivers search results pointing to those pages it automatically converts those fake static URLs into the dynamic HashBang URLs and directs traffic to them. I’m kind of surprised and shocked that Google did this, my only guess is that someone at Google built an app that worked this way and they needed to make it work with their search engine and now the Twitters and the Gawkers of the world are taking advantage of this and it’s really weakening the Web as a platform if you ask me.</p><p>So I think it’s about time to get our first guest on here, guys, we’ll come back to these stories if and when we can make it fit in, but our first guest here today is Miles Burke so let me give him a call here.</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> Thank you for inviting me!</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So for our listeners who don’t remember Miles, Miles is the author of the SitePoint book <a
href="http://www.principlesofsuccessfulfreelancing.com/">The Principles of Successful Freelancing</a>, and we had him on a while back to discuss that book and freelancing in general, so welcome back to the show, Miles.</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> Thank you, Kevin, it was a while back, it was back in December 2008. How time flies.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Oh, geez, did they podcasts back then?</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> That was number five. I think, Miles, you might have been our first interviewee actually.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yes, I think you were our first ever guest on the show.</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> Yes, and could you guys imagine that we’d be celebrating 100 episodes by now?</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> I thought they’d pull us off the air by now.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I’m a pretty confident guy, Miles.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> I thought they would’ve fired me by now. (laughter)</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So, Miles, the last time we spoke to you, you were kind of wrapping up if memory serves the final stages of converting your freelancing business into a web development … I guess would you call yourself an agency?</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> Yeah, we definitely call ourselves an agency, I think I had pretty well started that before we last spoke, but yeah certainly now we have a team of 15 and I have very little to do with actual on-tool work and I miss the days of Photoshop and Apache but now I’m spending the majority of my day with new business, with clients and managing projects behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So, Miles, your company is called <a
href="http://www.bam.com.au/">Bam Creative</a>.</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> Yes, that’s right.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> And do I remember you chatting to me a few months back and maybe even longer now that you were restructuring a bit to give your fellow Bam Creative staff a little more equity in the company?</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> Yeah, that’s right, that’s good memory there, Kevin, that was the beginning of last year so we’ve just experienced our first 12 months, what we did was we went to the current employees at the time and offered them shares in the business, so instead of a traditional here have some shares what they did was they actually purchased shares and became stakeholders and equity owners in the business.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah. So what was the thinking behind that move?</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> It was really driven by a few things. I guess my experience has been that I’ve always wanted to empower everyone that works for me to feel like they actually own a part of the business, and that’s something that I guess I’ve learned over the years in working for other people; I’ve always had that sort of underlying personality trait of feeling like I own any business I’m involved with, which as you can imagine I butted heads a number of times (laughter), but yeah, starting afresh with a new year last year, 2010, it seemed like the perfect time, and the result has been that I now have nine colleagues that are shareholders in the business and not literally just employees.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Is there a name for this sort of structure? I mean do you call it a co-op or something like that?</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> It is very similar to a co-op, there’s a few—</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Do you trade groceries? (laughter)</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> There’s a few names and few acronyms for it but employee invested organizations tends to be one that’s used as well as an employee-shareholder groups, so it’s worked out fantastically well. We’ve ended up with nine people that are happy to put blood, sweat and tears into the business and feel like they’re reaping the rewards as well.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So would you say it was a bit of nostalgia for the days when you were working solo and you were responsible for everything? Did you find you wanted to get everyone on the team working with that level of intensity?</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> That’s true. That is I guess a by-product of it was I felt like it was an exciting new business and that I was freelancing again, I just happened to be freelancing along with nine others under the same name, so it’s turned out really well; it’s one of those experiments that I had a number of clients say to me, oh, this is gonna be interesting, assuming the worst, but there touch wood hasn’t been a real argument yet, so it’s all worked out and everybody gets to vote on the direction of the business, what sort of projects that we take, what marketing activities we undertake, yeah, it’s worked out very well.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> We’ve got a question in the chat room from mmamedov, one of those difficult to pronounce screen names. mmamedov is asking what your advice for people wanting to start their own agency. Do you think the start as a solo freelancer route is the best way into running your own agency?</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> I believe so, yeah. I guess the difficulty, and this is worthy of a book in its own that we could put together later, but the difficulty is going from a one-man show upwards, so the first step is obviously hiring that first employee, and there’s a lot of work that needs to be involved there, and suddenly you feel that you’re hitting the pavement or working for others as well as yourself because you’re obviously having to keep them fed and clothed and employed. So, that tends to be the big jump going from a zero employee business to having one that you’re hiring, and then obviously the taxation and business structure elements that come with that. But I would thoroughly recommend that you start off freelancing first and see where the business takes you, and the other step there is also you don’t have to think of full time. So when I first started my first employee came on at one day a week, within a month he was two days a week, two months later he was full time, so having people that are flexible in as far as how many hours they can give you is very important at that phase of the business as well.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great. Do you think the Web is getting so complicated that pretty soon a one-man freelance operation is not gonna be practical?</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> To a degree I feel like that way already. I couldn’t imagine starting freelancing again and having to deal with the plethora of different issues that the Web faces now. When I first freelanced back in I think it was 1995 I was it, so I had the relationship with the hosting company, I did the design, I sold the projects to clients, I even made the coffee and vacuumed the office (laughter). And times have changed, the days of a simple sort of approach to SEO there was really no social media in any sense back then, now you’re faced with a million different issues that really you’re looking for specialists in these areas and trying not to be the all rounder for everything.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great. Well, thanks for answering those questions, we’ve unfortunately got plenty of guests to get through so we’re gonna have to let you go, Miles, but thanks for joining us for #100.</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> No problem, guys, and congratulations again on 100 episodes and I’ll be sitting around watching the chat room and keeping involved that way, thank you again.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Plenty more questions in the chat room for you Miles. If people want to catch up with you on Twitter or elsewhere where can they find you?</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> Yeah, certainly, I’m always interested in chatting with people on Twitter, so my username there is <a
href="http://twitter.com/milesb">@Milesb</a>.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great, well thanks a lot, Miles, we’ll let you go.</p><p><strong>Miles:</strong> Thanks guys.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Bye, bye.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright, our next guest is Alex Payne who many developers may remember from Twitter, he ran the Twitter API team and these days he’s working at a new startup called <a
href="https://banksimple.com/">BankSimple</a>, let me just get Alex on.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Hello Alex!</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> How are you?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Good. Welcome back to the SitePoint Podcast.</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alex, I had a good chat with you in the hallways at what was it, <a
href="http://www.eotw.com.au/">Edge of the Web</a> 2009 I think it was.</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Yes, in lovely Perth Australia where I was jetlagged out of my mind.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> (Laughs) Well, you did well on the Podcast, I remember it being one of my favorite sort of geekiest episodes because you were at that conference sort of chatting about where the Web as a platform was going.</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah. And since then you have left your work on the Web as a platform at Twitter and have started a new startup called BankSimple.</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Yes, yeah, I joined as the third co-founder in mid-2010.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So tell us a little bit about BankSimple and what was the string that led you from one place to another.</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> So, BankSimple is trying to be an alternative to retail banks, first in America and maybe eventually elsewhere in the world. And it was started actually by an Australian and an Indian who met at business school at Carnegie Mellon. And they were frustrated at how backwards banking in the U.S. is, we really have a lot of catching up to do particularly to Europe and the rest of the first world; people still use checks, not as much is done electronically as it could be, that sort of thing. So, BankSimple is kind of an experiment in seeing if we can build the next generation banking service for America, and I haven’t abandoned the platform thing entirely because part of what we’re offering will be an API.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Ah, excellent. I have to say I’m not surprised that an Australian is on the co-founders list because as a native Australian these days myself, well, not native, I’m from Canada, but living here in Australia and banking here in Australia it’s a nightmare as a tech geek.</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Yeah, and amazingly Australia is still better off than the U.S., I mean there’s more electronic bill presentment and that sort of thing in Australia from what Josh has told me, but even that still is really underused here.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah. Well, there are things that I envy about the United States as well, and I think they do fall in the realm of APIs, the stuff that you’re interested in, because you know just the industry standard for allowing your desktop personal finance app to communicate directly with your bank—can you refresh my memory, it’s OFX? Yeah, that’s right.</p><p>I have roughly every six months I sit down and Google and Google and Google looking for an Australian bank that supports it, and every once in a while I’ll find sort of a headline of a bank saying they’ve announced that they will support it but it hasn’t happened yet.</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Yeah. Well, and some banks in the U.S. while they’ll provide OFX they’ll charge people a monthly fee for it and then archive any data older than about three months off in their system to where it’s inaccessible to the user. So that’s the sort of thing that we want to change, I mean everyone should have access to their own banking data indefinitely and nobody should be charging for API access to it, that’s ludicrous.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Hmm. So would you say BankSimple is going to be a bank for geeks initially or are you trying to cater to the market as a whole?</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> We’re looking at the market as a whole and I think our focus is definitely not on geeks initially, although it’s been mostly geeky friends of ours who’ve been interested in the business and have signed up so far, we’ve gotten some good press coverage in more of the mainstream business press and the banking industry press but not so much the mainstream just yet. I think we’re really interested in people who are anywhere from their early 20s to their early 40s, generally a little bit more educated and professional as kind of the initial folks that we try this out with, people who feel like their financial lives are just a little bit too complicated and they’re wondering why banking can’t be more like just an app that you install and you put your money into it and it works on your behalf, that’s sort of the idea.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> And, you know, Kevin kind of asked something and I was kind of thinking because I looked at the service and it looks really neat so congratulations on that, and I thought this is a service that I, myself, could be interested in. But then I saw the requirement of Smart Phones, and so that made me think that okay is this a service that is more or less aimed at techies, which Kevin asked; I mean if you think about it in this light it’s okay we’ll charge less fees but you have to carry that data plan. So for some people, right, it might not actually save them money because I don’t use a Smart Phone myself, I have a lower technology phone, we’ll say that I pay $10.00 a month for, and save more money then I actually put in the bank, right, I get more money in the bank that way, right, so that’s a good thing, but I can’t use your service. So, I guess I’m curious on two points, first, from a development perspective why was that requirement important, and then second, moving forward how do you see that changing if at all?</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Well, sure. So, that’s sort of something we’re planning on doing for the first year or so that we’re in operation, we’re gonna be completely closed, invite only for a good long while, while we gather people’s feedback about the service and kind of change it accordingly. So the Smart Phone requirement hopefully gets us a class of user that’s gonna be more likely to give us feedback and hopefully to get instant notification so that if we’re having issues with the system or we want to alert them early about fraud and that sort of thing, all of those factors that kind of make them lower risk customers and make us a less risky proposition for them, that’s why we want to mandate Smart Phone usage at the beginning. I could see that kind of tapering off over time, although I think by the time we’re ready to open up Bank Simple to more people the average person will probably be carrying a Smart Phone, I mean in the next couple of years Android phones will be so cheap and subsidized in the U.S. that it’ll be difficult not to buy a Smart Phone, so I’m not too worried about that one.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> It feels a bit like the days when Apple first launched its iMac with no floppy disk drive and people were up in arms, but they were quite open about the fact that they were building a product that was going to be relevant for 10 years, not for the past three years, you know.</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Exactly. We’re definitely playing the long game with this business, I think all of us imagine that this is what we’re gonna be doing for a good long while, and if it takes a couple of years for more people to get Smart Phones in their pocket we’ve got a couple of years to build a lot of exciting stuff.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> You mentioned anti-fraud being sort of one of the drivers of technology in the BankSimple platform, and I have to say if there’s one place where my Australian bank does invest in technology it’s for anti-fraud, things that reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions and effectively save the bank money; I can get SMS alerts confirming ATM transactions and things like that on my phone, that’s stuff that my bank is investing in. How are you going to keep BankSimple’s priorities from veering off in the direction of being in the bank’s interest not the customer’s interest?</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Well, the thing that makes us really different is that we’re not a bank ourselves, there’s kind of a different structure that we operate under still very much within the realm of banking regulation, it’s not a new model at all. But we’re not a chartered bank, we don’t manage our own treasury, that kind of thing, we actually partner with multiple backend banks who hold deposits. So we’re in the business of developing technology and getting customers and keeping those customers happy, our partner banks are in the business of managing money, loaning that money out, that kind of thing. So our priorities are very distinct from those of our partners but ideally they’re mutually beneficial.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> Would you say then that you’re kind of the competitor to <a
href="http://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> in some way?</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Not really, actually we’ve already exchanged emails with folks at Mint about making sure that we open up our data to them as soon as we launch. I think tools like Mint are great for people who want to get the 10,000 foot view of their finances, the thing that we found frustrating about Mint is that it lets you view a lot of interesting information about your money but it doesn’t really let you take any action on it because they can read from your bank but they don’t have read/write privileges to your bank. So the thing that we’re doing a little bit differently is that we actively manage our customers’ money, and the things that Mint will send you an email about once every few weeks we actually just kind of do for you by default so that you’re not having to worry about that.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> Oh, cool.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I was hoping we could shift gears a little bit and talk about a story that we touched on at the start of this broadcast that has to do a bit with your previous employer Twitter. And this is the stuff that’s been going around about Hashbang URLs in the past week. Have you been following that?</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> I’ve looked at it a little bit. I’m definitely not a front-end technology expert by any stretch, my days of JavaScript are long over and I’ve been working on backend systems for the last few years, but people definitely seem to be in a tizzy about it.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, so the HashBang URL story has been going a bit nuts; in my imagination when I was reading these stories I was like, wow, so Twitter decided to put Hashbang URLs in, Alex Payne went “I can’t deal with this, I’m outta here, starting my own company!” (Laughter) You say you’re not a front-end guy, do you have a position on this stuff, do you think it’s a good idea or bad idea or is it just people trying stuff with the Web as they always have?</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Well, people are trying stuff, that’s fine, I mean I certainly got into arguments about URLs and URL schema design when I was working on Twitter’s API, and I just like a really clean, simple interpretation of kind of the RESTful bible, you know, just what are your resources, what are the sub-resources, what are the actions that you can perform on them. And this seems like it defeats that a little bit by having this meaningless thing, I mean if you look at scripts that have been written to parse Twitter URLs, when Twitter moved over to this convention all of those broke. Like for example the Campfire Group Chat utility that we have been using at work we would frequently paste Tweets in and then a little bit of client side code would say, alright, that’s a Tweet, I’m gonna go out and put together a nice CSS representation of that, and that broke when Twitter moved over to those URLs and people started copying and pasting links out of their browser. That sort of thing is probably an indication that you might want to go back to the drawing board, but I think Twitter has hired an amazing front-end team, they’re all absolute JavaScript experts and browser performance experts, I’m sure that they looked at what was available and decided that they couldn’t accomplish their client side goals any other way right now, but hopefully the HTML5 spec will shift a little bit to accommodate whatever it is that seems to require this from frontend developers.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah. Alright, well, it is coming up on quarter to 12:00 so we’ve got a whole lot more guests to get to, Alex; I wish we had more time.</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Well, no worries at all, I hope the rest of the show goes great and thanks for having me back on.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Thank you very much, look forward to having you on for, oh, say #250?</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Sounds good. (laughter)</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> We’d love to get you on when you’re ready to show off BankSimple to just anyone who wants in.</p><p><strong>Alex:</strong> Oh, yeah, that would be great, love to do it. Take care.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright, bye, bye.</p><p>So the thing about HashBang URL’s that really burned me, like I was kind of thinking alright, maybe it’s not the best choice but I got to congratulate them for trying stuff, but then I read and experimented and verified that one big thing that it breaks, and to me this isn’t getting enough airplay, is referrers. You know when you look at your Google Analytics stats and they tell you where people are arriving at your site from, that’s the HTTP <code>Referer</code> header that is providing that information, and it is completely missing form sites that are using these Hashbang URLs; if someone mentions your site on Twitter and people click through from the Twitter website all your stats will say is that they arrived from the homepage of Twitter, they don’t tell you which particular Tweet.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> I noticed that because I was looking at Google Analytics stats and I noticed that, it’s useless to me, you know, was it a specific Tweet or what did I do?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah. Alright, well, our next guest is Jina Bolton, let me get Jina on.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Hi.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Hello Jina!</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> How are you guys?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Very good, thank you. Good to hear from you. Alright, just Tweeting that you’re on with us here.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Can I just say that I love your website URL <a
href="http://www.sushiandrobots.com/">sushiandrobots.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Thanks (laughs).</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> That’s a great domain name.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Thank you.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright, well, Jina last time we had you on it was kind of a double feature, we had you and Elliot Jay Stalks on to talk about design, and I’d say if there’s one part of the web development universe that we don’t talk enough about on this podcast it is design, so it’s great to have you back on.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Yeah, definitely. I think we were talking about the 40-something shades of blue or something.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, we were talking about Google’s 43 shades of blue.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Has Google improved its design much since we last chatted?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> You know, I don’t really use a whole lot of Google products, but Gmail’s definitely gotten a lot better.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah. I know the skins for example are a big change, it seems like everyone I know has a different Google— Gmail skin these days. My girlfriend Jess likes the little ninja one.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> (Laughs)</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So, Jina, you’re a hard person to keep track of. It seems like every time I look in your direction you’re doing something different, you were at Crush + Lovely the last time we spoke having moved there from Apple, and now you’re where?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> I’m at <a
href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a>.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> What is Engine Yard?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> So, Engine Yard is basically a, they call it platform as a service, it’s kind of like a hosting company but it’s still in The Cloud, and it’s focused on Ruby so if you have a Ruby application you would put it on Engine Yard.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So <a
href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> being the big player in that space, but they got gobbled up, so are you the heir apparent?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Well, you know, we’re targeting different markets I think. I think Engine Yard’s kind of going after the bigger companies; Heroku kind of has like small companies that use them a lot.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright. So as the UX designer at a hosting company what exactly do you do? I don’t think of my web host as providing a lot of design to me.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> (Laughs) Yeah, I work on the product itself so it’s basically like if you were to login and manage your applications through the dashboard that’s basically what I work on, I’m a team of &#8212; it’s basically a team of two, there’s another really talented guy I work with named Andrew and we work iteratively to make sure the product is more and more awesome everyday.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So I guess it’s the interfaces that people are using to fire up their sites on Engine Yard, that’s what you’re trying to make as smooth and easy to use an experience as possible?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Yeah, basically.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So what drew you to that?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Well, I’ve worked on projects that were on Rails before so I was looking around for jobs in San Francisco because as much as I really loved Crush + Lovely they are in New York and I live in San Francisco, and I came across them on, well, I had seen them before but <a
href="http://jobs.github.com/">GitHub had just launched a jobs page</a>, so I was checking out some of the jobs listings and it just all kind of was good timing, they were hiring about the same time I was looking and I really liked the culture there and the people that I work with so it worked out really well.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> That’s wonderful. So it must be a big shift from working on a lot of different projects as you did at Crush + Lovely to really focusing on polishing the same app as much as possible over a long period of time. Is that a fair characterization of what you’re doing?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Pretty much, yeah, I’ve kind of bounced back and forth between the agency environment where I’m working on multiple client projects to working in-house like I did when I was at Apple. And I guess I see benefits to both sides, there is a lot of nice variety you get when you’re working on client projects, but then you’re dealing with clients so (laughs) I do like being able to iterate and constantly improve a product, so right now that’s definitely what I’m more interested in.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright. Now you’ve gone back to school at the same time as all this.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Yeah, I’m pretty busy. (laughter)</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, it’s weird, I don’t have a lot of people in my Tweet stream who are Tweeting about the day-to-day work of web development and also Tweeting about the stuff they’re studying for at school, so why that mix, obviously you’re an accomplished web designer, you’ve got a bright career ahead of you already, how does school fit in the mix?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Well, basically the number one reason I went back to school was because I want to teach, and a lot of American Universities, I’m not sure how it is outside of the U.S., but a lot of them require Masters Degrees so I had a Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic Design and Web Design, but I wanted to go ahead and get the Master’s Degree now before I end up settling down into something where I can’t, like maybe a job elsewhere or marriage or any of those factors. So, yeah, I decided to do a Master’s program and I do night classes because I work full time during the day, so yeah, I’m pretty busy most of the time.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> You’ve got a full plate, geez.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Yeah (laughter).</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Simuk in the chat says that he or she just realized that your book <a
href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/cssdesign1/">The Art &amp; Science of CSS</a> was the first SitePoint print book that he or she bought and that’s how they find out about SitePoint, so that’s pretty cool. Thanks for that.</p><p>So thanks for that. I just went a totally different direction, but what do you think of the HTML5 logo?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> You know, I don’t mind the logo that much; I don’t know that I would ever <em>use</em> it on anything but—</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I don’t mind it but I would not be caught dead in it is basically what that amounts to, right?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> (Laughs) Um, no, I actually think it’s kind of— It looks cool I just— I was surprised that they did it, I didn’t know a markup language needed a logo, but I think it looks alright, like it’s great on a t-shirt.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> It’s cute and adorable but just in a way kind of stand over there away from me sort of way. (laughter)</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So it’s an elitist logo is what you’re saying.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Uh, you’re putting words in my mouth now. (laughter)</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I’m putting words in Patrick’s mouth technically. So, Jina, something I’ve always wanted to ask you but have never really had the courage, you used to work at Apple and I think there’s this mystique about Apple, it’s a secretive place, I’ve always wanted to ask you and I figure now live on the air is the best possible time, what is it like to work at Apple?</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> We can’t edit this, now, we can’t edit this. So be careful … and go!</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> I think it’s awesome and I do hope to one day go back.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Okay. Because I assumed if you left it was because it was no fun to work there.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> No, if you’re interested in speaking at conferences and writing books it’s not really the place for you unless you’re super, super high up the chain and you go through a bunch of PR hoops, but if you’re into that maybe it’s not the best place to work, but otherwise it’s fantastic.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So you have to spend your time making awesome things and you’re not allowed talking about the awesome things you make, is that a good summary?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Like I think we talked about before, there is this mystique to Apple and they like to keep it that way, so they’re very protective of their brand and they’re very successful because they’re protective of their brand, and some people are okay with that. I want to talk about what I do, so, yeah.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> You can get a start there; you can go out, leave, make a name for yourself then come back later and be a higher up. That’s how it works.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Yeah, maybe, we’ll see if that ever happens but I do hope to one day go back when I’m kind of done doing the speaking thing.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great. Speaking about the speaking thing, the stuff you’ve been going around to conferences speaking about lately has been very much in the CSS arena.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Yeah, you know I have to be honest I was getting a little burned out talking about CSS because obviously I prefer design and my passion is in design, however, the last few talks I did were a little more in line with what I like to talk about and that’s workflow with CSS because I think there are a lot of people already out there talking about CSS3 and different techniques and things, and I don’t know how much more I have to contribute to that aspect of things, but when it comes to actual workflow and productivity I think that that’s something that needs to be talked about more.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Right. So I would say I like to describe a person’s journey with CSS in terms of stages, you know, there’s this stage where you understand the syntax but you’ve got more features then you can keep track of and you can’t figure out how to use them together to do anything useful. Then you start to understand how features like floats can be used to produce page layouts and you get your head around that and you start to wield CSS in anger, and then you get to this stage where every site you work on becomes 5,000 lines of CSS and you can’t remember which parts of it still are needed and belong on the site and you can’t find anything in all this code, and I suppose that’s where the workflow becomes important, right?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Definitely. And having, well, going back and forth between large companies and small companies you definitely start to learn where to create your own patterns and things to help make things faster and more efficient. Like right now at Engine Yard we actually use SASS which is amazing, if you’re interested in variables and mixins and I used to want to, I don’t know, I was kind of reluctant to use SASS at first because I was very picky and wanted to write my own CSS the exact way I wanted to write it, but I’m really embracing variables and I was super excited to see that that’s something that’s being talked about again in the CSS 3 world.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah. So SASS is this sort of language on top of CSS that lets you &#8212; it gives you a whole bunch more powerful language features and then you point this compiler at it and it turns it into CSS the browser can understand, right?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Pretty much, yeah.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So what’s your workflow with all that if you can take us through it like one minute or less?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Well, one of the things I worked on when I first came over to Engine Yard was sort of clean-up I guess, and there was a lot of repetition and things so I was trying to find areas in the UI where I can create patterns or variables that could be reused, and I actually just wrote <a
href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/front-end-maintainability-with-sass-and-style-guides/" title="Front-end Maintainability with Sass and Style Guides">a blog post at the Engine Yard blog</a> about how you can actually use that to do an online style guide, it’s been super helpful because you can use the very variables that you’re using within your style guide and it will generate the visual design that you need for like color palettes, buttons, all those things. So, yeah, I kind of sweep through looking for things that are used over and over again and turn those into either variables that makes sense so I can use those whenever I need it and then I update the style guide so that the developers I work with can also use those same variables.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Do you find this sort of workflow is something that everyone on the team has to be doing for it to work? Because I know once or twice I’ve been working on a team of developers and I’ve broken ground on the UI and started this style guide, but to get the whole team into the discipline of updating the style guide with any new user interface elements it wasn’t practical for me; how do you tackle that?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Well, you know, it’s definitely something the men and women that I work with have to get used to because they may have had their own way of doing things before Andrew and I came on board, but we’ve kind of taken the approach of bringing it up every time we can, and it’s like when they ask us questions like hey we need to do this it’s like, well, did you check the style guide, maybe it’s already there. (laughs) And I hate to use the world police but occasionally we kind of joke around about being like the design police, and just as they would make sure that we’re writing quality template code in the Ruby application we would do the same with them if they ever touch CSS, we would just bring it up and say hey please make sure you do this next time; you know you can only be called out so many times before you kind of start to remember the patterns and things.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So it helps if your job description makes you the one in charge of this stuff.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Yeah, and it’s kind of &#8212; I kind of like that that’s sort of become the case where anytime there’s markup or CSS now that needs to be written if the developers are writing it we have to kind of look at it first. And some people may not like that responsibility but I think it’s good because I can be a control freak especially for CSS, so as long as I get to look at it before you deploy it I’m happy. (laughs)</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> I have a quick question regarding the design trend that I’ve been noticing a lot lately, in fact, a lot of our host spotlights recently have been sites that have done this technique and I was just curious to get your thoughts on it. And I’m not sure of the official term on it but it’s basically where the website is one page and when you click on a menu item it scrolls down further on the page to that section that talks about whatever it was you clicked on. I’ve been seeing this a lot lately, in fact, Alex Payne’s new company BankSimple their homepage does the exact same thing so I’m curious to get your thoughts on, one, do you like that, have you noticed that as well, is that something you were starting to use or how do you think that looks, works?</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> The <a
href="http://crushlovely.com/">Crush + Lovely</a> website is like that with an exception to the blog and the portfolio which kind of click off into their own domains, but the rest of the site is a one-page scrolling site. And I think for certain aspects it can be really cool like announcement websites or small promotional websites, but as long as it’s developed in a smart way because what we found when we were working out the prototype for Crush + Lovely’s website it can be slow to load especially when you have a ton of content, and so there’s a couple different techniques I guess you could try like, what do they call it, infinite scrolling techniques or things like that. Yeah, I like them for the most part, I guess I found a couple times where I didn’t see any benefit to it and it just made the site load really slow, but for the most part depending on as long as the content is minimal I’m pretty fine with it.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> If done properly then it could be a nice technique.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright, well thanks for joining us for #100, Jina.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Thanks for having me back.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Thanks Jina.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Talk to you again soon.</p><p><strong>Jina:</strong> Alright, bye.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Bye, bye. Alright, always nice to get a designer’s voice on the Podcast.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> We need more designers.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, the world needs more designers.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> And a woman’s voice also, we need some diversity in this thing.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Good point, good point. Alright, I’ll just get our next guest on here. You probably know him from <a
href="http://typekit.com/">Typekit</a> but he’s been on the Web for a long time, our next guest is Jeffrey Veen.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Hello, hello.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Hi Jeff!</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> How’s it going?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great! Welcome to the SitePoint Podcast.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Thanks. Happy birthday, anniversary, how are you guys marking this event?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> (Laughs) We’re spending two hours chatting to people like you, it’s exhausting!</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> I can only imagine. That’s awesome and you’re doing this all live which I think is pretty impressive.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, we sure are.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Fantastic.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Well, welcome to the show, I think last time we spoke to you it was in the early days of Typekit, I’m not even sure you’d launched yet.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> No, I don’t think so, it seems like forever ago. Well, we’ve launched. (laughter)</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I’ll say. You guys have made a big splash and Typekit I’d say is looking pretty mature at the moment, meaning that in all the best ways.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah, well thank you, I think so. We have been working on it as a project for about two years now, and I guess we launched, well, let’s see, we launched three days before my son was born so that’d be 18 months ago, and that was in fact a busy week for me. But, yeah, I mean in this time sure Typekit has certainly grown a lot, but I think also any speculation that fonts and typography were gonna come to the Web in a big way and be supported by all the browsers and be embraced by designers, I think that point has been made, like in the last year and a half just everywhere fonts, you see fonts, and that makes me really, really happy.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> There’s no question. So, what I’m thinking, what I wanted to ask you about first is when we first talked about Typekit you started a new company to launch Typekit and it was called Small Batch, is that right? So it seems to me the idea there is Small Batch would be going on to do more things like Typekit. Sitting where you are now roughly a year into Typekit’s life, and Typekit has exploded and is hugely successful, you, Jeffrey Veen, are you on to the next thing at this point or has Typekit become this swirling vortex that has sucked all of your time and there’s no getting out of it?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> (Laughs) Oh my God, no, we’re not doing anything else. In fact, now the company is called Typekit Incorporated, we’ve totally changed over to that and focused to Typekit 100%, in fact, we have 15 people, or 16 actually now, working full time on Typekit so, yeah, it is all of our attention. I wouldn’t so much call it a vortex that sucks my time so much as a thing that I could not be happier devoting all of my energy into, right, like it just— and honestly it is so rewarding because we have not only a fantastic kind of set of customers but a community has been forming sort of around our blog and around our Tweeting and all that kind of stuff, and around the gallery and the sites that we showcase; it barely feels like work. I mean it’s a tremendous amount of work but it’s just incredibly fun, we’re having a blast.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Sounds like a child, right, a child doesn’t suck up your time it’s just a delight.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> That’s right. Actually both of those things are totally true, you have no time for anything else and it’s absolutely delightful so, yeah, it’s great.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So, we had a couple of questions in the chat room here on the live show, and one of them comes from Mohammed and he asks, I guess referencing <a
href="http://code.google.com/webfonts">Google Web Fonts</a> and the launch of that, how did that affect Typekit in any way and how do you see it as competition?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> We actually coordinated the launch of Google, the <a
href="http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/">Google font API</a>, along with our own Open Source project that we collaborated with those guys on, it was called the <a
href="http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader.html">Web Font Loader</a>, it’s an Open Source way that allows anybody to use kind of any service or even hosting their own fonts on their own server but with a sort of consistent name space and a consistent set of methods and JavaScript events and font events and things like that. And so we work with them really closely, like we talk to them all the time, not just about the Web Font Loader but also all of the fonts that are in the Google font API are also available on Typekit. And it has been actually a really great collaboration for us. As you guys probably know, the core team that’s building Typekit was at Google two years ago, right, we were part of an acquisition, we did the redesign of Google Analytics, we did a bunch of things over at Google, and then we left Google to start our own thing and that’s been Typekit. So we have a ton of friends and colleagues over at Google and we work with them all the time. So what makes me really, really happy about what Google is doing is that they’re investing in Open Source fonts, and Open Source fonts I think just make so much sense because you can have an individual designer that solves a particular problem for a particular character set and then open it up to anybody to help contribute additional glyphs or to help with currenting or to help with hinting, and people can sort or collaborate I mean kind of like any other Open Source project, right; the more hands you get on there the more shallow the problems seem to be. And that’s where Google has really invested and I am very, very pleased with that.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So is the idea that the Open Source technology enables very specific fonts solving very specific problems but companies like Typekit make money out of the generalized fonts?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well, sure, it’s a little bit. The analogy doesn’t hold perfectly but think about it a little bit like how &#8212; like what GitHub has done, right, that’s Open Source software freely available but they’ve turned it into a service so that all of the sort of difficult parts, running your own server and keeping permissions up and keeping the latest build installed and all that, like they do all of that, they build on top of Open Source software, and so in some ways that’s similar to parts of our business as well, and that’s a business model that I think is interesting and more and more prevalent as Open Source software becomes more robust.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> We got a question from the chat room, user name BWformula would like to know how many fonts are you up to now.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Thousands!</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> It looks like it’s growing.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> We want an exact count so find the number and come back (laughter), just kidding.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> I need to login to the database a minute, I’ll be right back. It’s well over 4,000 now, I don’t think we’ve hit 5,000 now. I mean that number to me is less important as the user experience of finding the exact font that you want, right, so we could have another 200 handwriting fonts but at some point they start to get &#8212; it starts to get more of the same, right, so what we’re trying to do is find the best fonts for the Web which is significantly different than the fonts that have been out there for the print world forever. They perform differently, there’s different use cases, and all of that kind of stuff leads me to believe that it’s not the size of the library that matters so much as the quality of the fonts that people are really selecting. And as you can imagine, like if we go look at our own analytics and how fonts are being used and the traffic that those fonts see, it’s that power curve there, there’s a core set of fonts that everybody loves that works really well in browsers and then this long tail for very specific instances where people need something that’s a little outside of the norm.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Now in retrospect how prepared would you say you were for the world of web fonts going into this? Were there a lot of surprises for you along the way? I guess was Typekit harder to build than you were expecting or easier?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Uh, well, I will say that it is a truism that if an entrepreneur knew what they were getting into we would never have any entrepreneurs, like if you had any idea, like you never know, but that’s actually part of the thrill of it is that a year or two years ago we clearly saw like web fonts is gonna happen finally, the browsers are there, we started talking to foundries, they were starting to get excited, and we were like we can put this together and this is totally gonna work. Having no idea what the problems would be, I mean we knew it would be a lot of work, we just didn’t know exactly what the problems would be and now those have really become evident and it’s been &#8212; it has been a ton of work; I don’t know if it’s more work than we thought, it’s just it’s different work than we thought. Nobody really understood the degree to which fonts would render very, very differently in different browsers, in different operating systems, in different versions of operating systems, and I think that has to do with the fact that lots of designers have always worked on a Mac and fonts have always just kind of looked good on screen on a Mac, and there weren’t a lot of settings, right, where you can turn aliasing on and off or only use grayscale aliasing or ClearType instead or any of that kind of stuff that is common in the Windows world. So you would think, right, like we thought two years ago well of course you would put a font on the Web and you’d link it up via CSS and it would show up in the browser, and it turns out there are probably 32 different ways that it can possibly render and so we need different font formats and different hinting styles and all that kind of stuff just to get some level of consistency and rendering across all these browsers. So it’s a little bit like when we first started with remember dynamic HTML back in the 90s, right, like we thought this is gonna be amazing! And we start working with it and go it works differently everywhere and there’s bugs everywhere and oh my, God, like you know 60% of our time ends up debugging and doing all the different versions for the 40% of creative energy that we put in, and that’s certainly been the case with rendering for fonts as well.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> And how successful do you say you are on the current browser technology, do things mostly look the same after you put all your work in or is it a best effort still?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> It is really a best effort, and one of the things I’ve learned that really resonates is that the fonts actually don’t need to look the same in every browser to the designer working on the website, even though you would think that would be the case, right, the reality is the fonts need to be what your end users expect to see. So if they’re expecting to see things that only antialiased in grayscale, suddenly seeing things shift into ClearType is sort of disorienting for people who especially considering we’re working with text and paragraphs and like reading and legibility and readability, and that kind of stuff is incredibly important to people. So I would say there is no solution, there is no end state where everything works perfectly, and I don’t think there will be until everybody has a retina display on every device, right, like on your laptop and your desktop and your every phone and tablet and everything, because at that point then you have enough resolution so that it kind of looks like print, right.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I don’t care what it costs I’m first in line for that when it comes out.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> When there’s a retina display everywhere.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> A desktop retina display.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah, yeah. And we’ll get there, right, and just like we’ve done with processor speed and RAM and broadband and every other technology that sort of follows these curves of adoption.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So when we last spoke the biggest question in my mind was whether you guys were going to be able to successfully wrangle or get the signoff of the people actually making fonts, that was the big question, licensing; would the people making the fonts hand over the key and trust you with distributing their product online. Is that battle fought and won now or is that something you’re still dealing with day in and day out?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> There’s still plenty of opportunity that’s out there, but I think having some of the really big names behind Typekit now and working with us and being really good partners has proven that we sort of proved the model, right, so we’ve FontShop and we’ve got Adobe and we’ve got Type Together and Process Type Foundry and all these amazing people doing fantastic work while at the same time we’ve seen a lot of competitors spring up which we expected to see and realized that that would be the case, so Monotype and that whole collection of fonts is doing their own font service and I think that’s fantastic, it keeps the momentum going when there’s healthy competition in place.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright, Jeff, well it has been all too brief but we’re gonna have to let you go.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well this has been wonderful.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Thank you. Do you want to let you know where to follow you these days?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Oh, you know, you can follow us on Twitter, we’re <a
href="http://twitter.com/typekit">@Typekit</a>, and at typekit.com you can check out all the web fonts and see everything we’re doing over there.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright, well thanks again, Jeff, look forward to speaking again soon.</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> I hope so, thanks guys.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Bye, bye.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Thanks, Jeff.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Gosh it was great to hear from Jeff again. I’ll just get to work on getting our next guest on; Brad, this one I expect you’re a little excited about, we’ve got Matt Mullenweg from WordPress on next.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Yeah, definitely, it’s always fun to talk with Matt and see what fun things they have going on.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Hello Matt!</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> Hi.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Welcome to the SitePoint Podcast or welcome back I should say. Great to have you on again. And for those who don’t know him, the man who I doubt needs much introduction in these circles, but Matt why don’t you introduce yourself.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> Sure, my name is Matt Mullenweg and I’m co-founder of WordPress which is blogging and CMS software, and about five years ago I founded a company called <a
href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> which runs WordPress.com, Akismet, PollDaddy and a few other things.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So, last time we talked about WordPress I can’t remember, Brad do you remember if 3.0 had come out yet?</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Well, when we initially did the interview it was back in August of 2009 so, no, 3.0 was definitely not out, I think we were right around 2.8, Matt might know better; it’s been a while since we’ve chatted.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So, Matt, for me looking in the rearview mirror at the WordPress landscape 3.0 is still the biggest milestone that I can think of, and that’s from like a developer perspective, that for me signals the biggest shift in the platform. For you looking from the inside at how WordPress is used on the Web was 3.0 as big a deal as we developers think it was?</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> I think 3.0 was really a signal to folks that we were becoming more serious about WordPress as a CMS, so a lot of the infrastructure and code for the things that we talked about in 3.0 has been there for four or five years, it was really the first time we built the APIs around it that made it easier for people to use.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, and it seems like for me the reason 3.0 was such a big deal was the shift from WordPress is focused on blogs as a blogging platform to WordPress is now being designed as a generalized content management system and a blog is just one of those configurations.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> Yeah, I think what we saw is just we’re continually amazed by what people do with WordPress, and just calling it a blogging system really doesn’t do justice to the amazing things people are building with the software.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Well, Brad, you’re our resident WordPress expert, do you want to field some— or, uh, serve a few questions Matt’s way?</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Or if Matt wants to ask Brad some things, he’s welcome to as well! (laughter)</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Yeah, I definitely have some questions. I’m sure you saw the study that came out that essentially said WordPress powers is about 13% of the top million sites which is an insanely impressive stat, so my question would be knowing that WordPress holds that large of a chunk of those large sites how can WordPress keep it going five years from now, what’s going to keep WordPress on top, it’s already I think most people would say it’s at the top now as far as publishing platforms go, it’s one of the most widely used; how can it stay there, how can it keep growing?</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> My first thought when I saw that number is that we have 88% to go. (laughter)</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> That’s a good way of looking at it.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> I think the way to look at it is it’s a natural trend of what we’ve been doing already is WordPress as a platform, you see things that are being built on top of WordPress, and they almost just use it as a development framework. They sort of bootstrap the user and content management stuff and then build something completely else on it from ecommerce to real estate management to almost anything, and WordPress can become a very efficient distribution mechanism for that. So the beautiful thing about that is that people don’t have to keep reinventing the wheel especially with regard to GPL, PHP software, you get so much for free inside of WordPress, the update system and the frameworks for everything, the user management, that you can just include it essentially just like you would one of these—the Zend framework or something like that—have a really neat app that people will already know how to use if you follow WordPress’ design and user interface conventions. So we’ve definitely got maybe like another 10 or 15% to go of the Web from the CMS point of view, but beyond that I think you really start to get into these other applications, other things that people make websites for.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> What are your thoughts on developers who are starting up and considering sort of it seems like as a web developer once upon a time the first thing you learned once you wanted to go past front-end development was PHP, and these days there seems to be this new path that people can learn WordPress first and then learn PHP from WordPress out, did that surprise you that WordPress became so successful that developers were starting their careers on WordPress and in some cases you can have a years-long career as a web developer without ever working on anything except WordPress.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> Actually I’m surprised so many people are able to do it because our documentation is so bad and it has so far to go with regards to the documentation and everything.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> There are some good books out there.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> They’re starting to be but, for example, there’s plenty out there of good Open Source books, how come there’s nothing under the same license of WordPress itself…</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> …that we can point to, that people could still sell…</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Ouch, ouch.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> …but this is something we’re thinking about. And as we grow I think it’ll be interesting to see will the same sort of incentive structure and sort of methods that have allowed the ecosystem for WordPress to become so big with the core and with … (inaudible) … will also be able to apply to the things around it, like services, documentation and books … (inaudible) … that’s still pretty much an open question.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, definitely. Speaking of the ecosystem of WordPress, one of the news stories we touched on at the top of this program was the blog post by the ex-member of Six Apart, and he talked a bit about how one of the reasons he felt WordPress had triumphed, if you will, in the blog platform race was that WordPress’s community, its—I suppose community is as good a word as any—it’s ecosystem was really focused around promoting WordPress as the best solution to the detriment of its competitors, what would you say to that?</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> Well, I don’t know if I agree because if you go back eight years when WordPress was just starting I mean Movable Type had a much, much, much, much better community, it had plugins, themes, a number of the things that make WordPress popular weren’t even around. I think part of it comes down to the tenor of the community, so— Actually, I don’t even know if it’s that; it’s very hard to look in hindsight and see why one thing did well and why something else did well. If I had to look at what we did well then I would love to continue, it’s really being responsive to our users and talking to users as well as listening to as many people as possible and trying to keep the software one step ahead.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Would you agree that the licensing that Movable Type implemented probably had a negative effect on their growth and ultimately led to a lot of users coming over to WordPress?</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> I mean maybe but they went Open Source a few years ago, so a lot of these things that you could point to it’s hard to say this is the definitive one. If I had to pick one thing above all others I would probably say that, it was maybe a matter of focus or at Six Apart they had a lot of brilliant engineers and designers and everything, but it seems like their focus was sometimes divided between their many platforms, between our general type ad box and Movable Type, and probably particularly Box; it seemed like Movable Type wasn’t getting as much attention within the company which is pretty hard, 150 to 200 people, as everything else and so users can kind of tell that.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, is that something that you’d say you’ve had to be very deliberate about at Automattic, is maintaining that focus? I’m thinking of things like merging WordPress MU back into WordPress Core, that has neatly avoided that split focus between those two products. Have you had to avoid the temptation to work on new things when the other choice is to reinvest in WordPress, which is this project that you’ve had going for years now?</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> That’s a good question. I should also say in my last answer I have no inside information about what happened there or even if that’s the thing that really matters, but for us I think that it’s partly just that we’re definitely if you go to automtattic.com the homepage, they have a lot of different products, but we only have one that does blogging. (laughter) So although we’ll have like PollDaddy and Akismet and VaultPress and a few other things, they tend to be very, very complementary to WordPress as a core platform so everything we do is built around WordPress. And a really key decision early on, even prior to the merge of MU and everything, was that WordPress.com would run the same code that you could download off the website on WordPress.org, and that’s been a little more work but I think that alignment of the platform, the technical alignment, has meant that every additional engineer of Automattic and all the investment we put into the platform really all goes back to the Open Source. And, combined with really focusing on growing the Open Source community as well, so making it more open, bringing in more developers from the outside, making more of the decision making processes community driven as opposed to just being me, these sorts of things are tough and sometimes it bugs me a little that I can’t just go in and change anything I want in WordPress like I used to, but it also makes it a lot more robust because there’s a lot more people getting involved in the creation of WordPress and that really have ownership about it beyond me, beyond even Automattic, beyond even just the people getting paid for it; you have a really large community around WordPress that’s very invested in the development and it’s really smart folks too, I enjoy every single WordCamp, every single Meetup, meeting these people.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Well, speaking of other things, I wanted to ask you a little bit about <a
href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a> because online community is sort of my thing, I’ve been managing online communities for 10 years as an area of interest for me, and when people ask me about forum software options, and I’m of the opinion that we have a lot of great options out there, and one of the options I include sometimes when people ask is bbPress, and once in a while someone will respond and say well that’s not being developed or nothing’s happening there, so I was kind of curious what your thoughts were on kind of the future of bbPress from this point.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> So, bbPress used to be its own distinct platform, in fact if you download it from the site today it is. The downside is that that platform is like 80% code copied from WordPress so we were having to maintain it in two places. So we sort of came to a juncture much like the merging of MU in WordPress into the multi-site feature where it’s like this doesn’t really make sense as a stand alone thing.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> You broke up there for a little bit, Matt, were you saying that the vision is to hopefully turn bbPress into a plugin or a set of plugins for the core WordPress?</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> Exactly, that’s what we’re working on. So it would maintain all the features and there’d be a data migration process and everything but it became a plugin for WordPress using WordPress as a platform, much like I said earlier. We have probably 30 or 40 different bbPress installs that we run ourselves with millions of millions of hosts and users between them, so bbPress is really important even just for our own use. And I think once it becomes a plugin we’ll start to see a lot wider adoption from everywhere because if you look at it you never have a forum on its own. I mean at SitePoint the forums are such a huge part of the community but there’s also an amazing website; if you run WordPress with a website then you’ll have something to integrates with the user system everything else, as just a drop-in for the community aspect.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright, well thank you very much for making time for us today Matt.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Thanks Matt.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> My pleasure. And I also really appreciate how SitePoint has been developing, you’re just doing more around WordPress; I love it when you guys— I love to see you guys around the community so keep up the good work.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great, thank you very much! Bye, bye.</p><p><strong>Matt:</strong> Bye, bye.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright, great to hear from Matt, he made time for us, he was coming to us from the road, I think he was using Skype on his mobile phone there, so a couple of dropouts here or there but it’s marvelous that he could be on for us at all, so just thanks again Matt Mullenweg for joining us.</p><p>We have one more guest here today, and I can’t wait to get him on, he’s been on a couple of times if not even three on the SitePoint Podcast. We’ll have our regular wrap-up afterward, we’ve got host spotlights and a bit of reflection on the past for you here, but up next is Chris Wilson, so let me give Chris a call. Hello Chris.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Hey.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Welcome back to the SitePoint Podcast! I would have to check my records but I would say you would be tied for first place for a person who’s been on our show the most often so it’s great to get you on again. So Chris you come to us from a different part of California today than you would have last time.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well, actually I didn’t move so I’m still up in Seattle, but I definitely do have a different employer.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Oh, wow, okay. So why don’t you break the news.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Sure. So back in September I left Microsoft, I’d been there for about 15 years and it was kind of time to try something different, took a little bit of time off and then I started working for Google and my current project is Google TV.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Wow, okay, so that was a huge move for you because you have been at Microsoft for as long as Internet Explorer has existed if not before.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Almost, yeah, I actually started and started working on the IE team on IE 2.0, so I actually think I did one check-in in IE 2.0 but definitely had been there a long time, had seen a lot of changes and a lot of— gone through a lot of cycles particularly with Internet Explorer.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So we have plenty to chat about but let’s start with Internet Explorer. We’re looking at just this past week, <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/02/10/acting-on-feedback-ie9-release-candidate-available-for-download.aspx">Internet Explorer 9’s release candidate came out</a> and I think you’ll agree it’s looking pretty great.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, actually there are a couple of surprises in there even for me, I was happy to see geolocation made it in because that’s something I’ve felt kind of passionately about in IE for quite a while.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Right. So how much did you have to do with Internet Explorer 9, was it well under way before you left?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well, so I actually for about the last year and a half or so of my time at Microsoft I was over working on the JavaScript Engine team, so I was actually lead PM for the JavaScript Engine, really focused on the runtime, not even the Document Object Model as much although the interfacing there of course was a big work item for us so we spent a lot of time working together on that, but I spent a lot of time just working on the core runtime, learning tons of stuff frankly about the internals of JavaScript and how it works that I just had no idea about before which was kind of cool. So, you know, IE 9 was definitely well under way during that time, I moved over to the JavaScript Engine team right after we shipped IE 8.0 so it was kind of I moved over, kind of helped participate in the planning but mostly from the JavaScript side.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> And refresh my memory, is the JavaScript Engine technically a part of the Windows platform or the IE platform?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well, so Windows and IE are kind of in the same area, but the JavaScript Engine Team at least during my entire tenure at Microsoft I think was over in the developer division because dev-div really experienced with building runtimes, you know that’s where the CLR is built and various other runtimes have been built historically, so a lot of the hardcore language guys are over in that division.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So the other thing you were working on around that same time was the HTML 5 Working Group. And you were co-chair of that working group.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I was co-chair of that working group for quite a long time, and I guess it was summer before last so just about a year and a half ago I passed that off to a couple of people actually, I’d been co-chairing with Sam Ruby who I think is still co-chairing, and Paul Cotton from Microsoft a guy who’s been around the standards world and Microsoft for a very long time, super smart, very motivated, and he took up the co-chairship as did Macie from Apple.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright. So now that you’re no longer involved day-to-day in that standardization process I was wondering if I could pick your brain on your thoughts on sort of that process as it exists because when we last spoke you— There was some stress in your voice when we talked about this stuff, put it that way.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> (Laughs) I can imagine, yeah. You know HTML is a pretty tough thing to standardize, frankly, because there’s always been a very strong tension between the need to actually get stuff built, get it delivered and just work together and crank it out as quickly as possible, and of course actually having a standard that is very, very meticulously designed and has tests for everything so it can actually show whether you’re doing it right or not. And I think the current way of building that has been, well, I mean a lot of HTML5 was really take what’s already out there that all the browser implementers have had to go reverse engineer what the behavior is anyways and figure out how to exactly specify that behavior so that the next person who comes along to build a browser engine doesn’t have to start by reverse engineering, they can actually say I’m just gonna go read the spec and the spec will tell me everything I need to know. But for the new features and the new functionality that’s in there you know anytime you move really fast of course you end up with some interoperability issues and you have to resolve those over time, you know the current thinking on that at least from the WHAT Working Group perspective is kind of we’ll just keep refining the spec as we go and it’ll be this living standard and change over time, and to some degree that’s very attractive, that’s in a lot of ways you do need to make sure that your standard isn’t in stasis, right, that it does change over time and it does improve and it does— it is actively being developed. But at the same time that’s really hard to target in a market where web developers need to build content and have that just work at point A in time, and point A plus two years it probably still better work and hopefully without more intervention or the customers and clients are gonna get kind of upset.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, it’s a weird sort of blip in the standards landscape that we exist in at the moment where the best standard for someone building a browser to consult today is also the standard that contains the most experimental sections as well, the sections that as a browser developer you would probably want to stay away from for the moment.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That’s probably true. I mean one of the challenges of course with standardization has always been you can’t really declare something done and right as a standard until you’ve tested it, right, and by testing it I mean you have to build implementations, multiple implementations, not one, not two, three or more preferably, and then you have to deliver it out into the wild and you have to get people to use it and you have to get them to pound on it for a while and see if it’s actually working for them, like if it’s the best way to design that functionality, and of course that’s really hard to do because nobody wants to be just the experimental browser builder, like you actually do want a real user market, and of course developers don’t really develop for the experimental browser anyways, right, they want an actual consumer browser that people are using in the real world to build really cool stuff on.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> The standards body itself, The Working Group, the public mailing list as it became, it’s a noisy place and the impression from someone who’s given up on monitoring it, speaking for myself, is that it’s a noisy place of big egos attacking each other but hopefully that ends up producing a reasonably good end product, although anyone who’d been involved in it would feel like they’d gone to war. Do you think that’s the only way to do it?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well, I mean I think that when we got into, when we sort of revived the HTML Working Group we had a very, very big challenge which was there was this view of HTML at the W3C as very ivory tower, right, that it was all on XHTML 2.0 and it was really not focused on the real world of what browsers wanted, what web developers wanted, what engine people out there wanted, and the best thing that we could think of to do at the time of course to attract those people back in to try to build it under the very important, by the way, patent policy of the W3C was to open up The Working Group as much as possible and to make it very easy to join and very low-cost to join, low-cost meaning like it didn’t take you a ton of time, you didn’t have to sign up to travel to a Working Group meeting once a quarter or anything like that. And the challenge with opening it up for anyone to join of course is that anyone can join and there are tons and tons of people who are interested in HTML, lots of people who are getting their opinion out there, and I think the challenge with anything like that is you can either build a standard with a very small set of people in the room and maybe you don’t have enough people in the room, maybe you don’t have the right set of people in the room, or you can actually open it up to everyone and then try to deal with how you drink from that fire hose of talk and chatter on The Working Group list. And you know in retrospect I’m not sure if there’s something that I would change about that particular aspect, I think it’s pretty hard to, you know, it was very hard to try to keep on top of everything that was going on in that working group and do would be several other jobs, my day job, but it’s pretty important I think to be open in that respect; I think most of the working groups it was interesting for a while not working for Microsoft or Google because I took about six weeks off between my jobs, and looking at those conversations not just the HTML working group but the other working groups and seeing what I could still look at and what I couldn’t because I wasn’t a member because of Microsoft and I wasn’t a member because of Google, so what conversations could I still watch and how did that make me feel about standard development.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Boy oh boy, if I had six weeks off between working at Microsoft and Google I probably wouldn’t spend it reading standards conversations I have to say (laughter), that is dedication my friend.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well, it certainly wasn’t all of my break.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So speaking of Google, you work on the Google TV team now.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I do.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So that’s a big move for someone who’s been at Microsoft for as long as he has, would you say that move had more to do with what you were looking forward to working on or more about you felt like you’d done everything you could at Microsoft in your time there?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> You know, a little bit of both. I spent a long time at Microsoft and I certainly, I never expected myself to be at Microsoft as long as I was, I never expected to be anywhere that long, and there are a lot of things about Microsoft that are very attractive as a company to work for, I think they treat their employees pretty well, they have some really good internal systems that help kind of manage people and manage things that you have to do there and it’s very well supported in that respect. I think that there’s a tremendous opportunity for Microsoft to affect people because they do tend to have huge, huge user markets, I mean the hardest part about leaving Microsoft was thinking about the fact that Internet Explorer has like three-quarters of a billion users, and I’m giving up the opportunity to work with those three-quarter of a billion users and maybe will build that into whatever products I work on in the future, maybe we won’t, but that was always a big attraction was affecting that many people’s lives and how they could use computers. At the same time I kind of felt like the things that I’d been championing at Microsoft and in Internet Explorer particularly you know they were kind of, they were coming back around, I think IE9 sort of proves that they’ve got a lot of skin in that game, they’ve built some really impressive stuff, and I think that it was sort of time for me to think about what I wanted to affect next and where I wanted to go next.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> I’ll ask the obvious question here, when you made the move to Google I guess the obvious department for you to be a part of would be the Chrome section; was that ever discussed or was it when you went over to Google TV was what you were going to Google to work on?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well, I mean the interesting thing about Google is that more than any other company I’ve worked for before they tend to hire people, and the way that they set up their internal structures I mean everyone’s heard of Google’s 20% time, and really that’s about a way to get people to build cross pollinating projects that are maybe riskier than you would normally get into. And just the idea of the set of people that I would go to work with because obviously I know a ton of people who work at Google, I’ve worked with a bunch of people who work for Google now, a bunch of people in the Seattle office actually are people that I used to work with or for at Microsoft in the past, so it was really compelling to know I was gonna go to this place where there were tons of super bright people and they have this way of kind of encouraging people to take on different roles and different projects at the same time.</p><p>Now, as for going to Google TV versus Chrome versus something else, I mean getting right back into something that I just did didn’t seem like a really great idea for a variety of reasons, and the interesting thing about Google TV to me was really that it’s kind of a catalytic project, like the idea of Google TV is not “Hey let’s go build this device that everyone is gonna go want to buy immediately,” it’s really you know right now all of the televisions and Blu-ray players and everything else they’re all getting into this “connected TV” thing, right, they’re all getting Smart TV, Connected TV, Internet TV, IPTV, whatever they want to call it, but the problem is a lot of these are using platforms that aren’t consistent, and when you look at somebody like Netflix, for example, who’s been tremendously successful in deploying to a large number of those devices, they have to build an implementation of their code for each one of those devices and ship it. And Google TV was really into the idea of saying hey number one, well, let’s build a device based on Android because just like Android is doing in the mobile phone space where it’s unifying a bunch of platforms that were previously built, it can do that for the TV space and on top of that as well, of course, hey let’s make the Web the platform, right; if you go and look at Google TV as it is today a lot of the applications that we put on Google TV, that we put in our spotlight which is what we call kind of the, well, the spotlight, right, the set of things that we push to people on a regular basis, users, on a regular basis, those things are built on a web platform, like that’s the easiest and to some degree right now certainly the best way to deliver new applications to people is build a web application, make sure that it’s optimized for the TV space but go push that to people. And one of the super attractive things to me about that was the web platform on Google TV is just the web platform; like when I go and work with third parties to get them to optimize their sites or applications for Google TV it’s really not optimizing for Google TV, it’s optimizing for TV, right, it’s optimizing for the user is ten feet away from their screen, they’re not two feet away from their screen. They probably don’t have a mouse or they don’t want to use it, they want to use a directional pad to navigate around, you know, don’t put small hit targets all over the screen, make sure text is pretty big, your resolution is gonna be 1080p or 720p, and oh TV’s tend to over-saturate colors so try to stay away from pure white on pure black kind of thing.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So it’s a repeat of the process we’ve seen with Smart Phones, where people need to—</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It is exactly that, yes. It’s exactly that idea, and this is something that I’ve felt strongly about for a long time is that the web platform has had this ability to sort of be applicable to multiple media spaces for many years, right, I mean like we designed this in CSS a super long time ago, and most people haven’t really used that until the sort of onslaught of mobile devices accessing the Web and using the Web platform, because prior to that you could pretty much presume, oh, people had a 1024 x 768 window so use that and size things to that and they’re gonna be able to use scroll bars and all the rest of it, and now some of those rules are changing both for the mobile space and I think in the near future for the TV space.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So in a way you can say that Chris Wilson has not left the Web behind in his role at Google TV you’re just bringing the Web to a new screen.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I mean I don’t think I could actually leave the Web behind in my professional life, it’s something that I’m extremely passionate about and don’t see that passion going away anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great. Well, we have to let you go again, Chris, I’ve been saying this to every guest, it’s a pleasure to chat and I’m sorry we didn’t have more time for you today.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It was always a pleasure to talk with you and to be on the Podcast so thanks.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright. We’ll let you go, bye, bye Chris.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Thanks, Chris.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Thanks, Chris.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> And if you’d like to follow Chris and his movements you can follow him on Twitter <a
href="http://twitter.com/cwilso">@cwilso</a>, and you can follow him on just about any other web community at that same name. If you want to get the story behind that name you’ll have to go back and listen to previous episodes of the SitePoint Podcast where he was a guest. And that is it for our parade of big names from the past of the SitePoint Podcast. Wow guys, I am overwhelmed and at the same time I wish we had a full hour with each of those voices.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> We pretty much pulled those all from the first 25 so imagine if we grabbed every interviewee we ever did, we’d be here all night.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> We’ll have to an eight-hour episode for #250.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> A 24-hour marathon. (laughter)</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Guys, what do you remember of #1 and everything that went into making that happen, our very first episode, or I should say <em>your</em> very first episode?</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I remember that Brad was sort of the kind of the lead on it—</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Brad was the lead host.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Yeah, I went back because it’s been a while since I’d seen when exactly we started, when the conversation got started, and the original post was on June 27, 2007 and this was on the admin side of SitePoint, this wasn’t a public post this was a kind of internal discussion on hey what do you think about podcasts and it actually all stemmed from Sarah who interviewed Matt and Mark who were the co-founders of SitePoint, which I listened to and really enjoyed, I was like why don’t we do this every week so it kind of went from that. But I think the first episode came out November 10, 2008, so over a year since the conversation had started to get episode one out the door.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> It was a year of people going oh we should have a podcast; yeah we should definitely have a podcast, let’s do something about having a podcast, and then three weeks of silence.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> And then Brad to his credit kind of took the initial kind of thing there because I remember I said, and this is what I said, I’m on two podcasts and this is what I said to both, I said I will show up and I will be prepared and I will talk but I will not edit anything, so I’m like I will be there but I’m just not gonna edit anything, so you know that was not necessarily the boldest of commitments but I think Stephan maybe made a similar comment and we got it together and once everybody proved they were &#8212; Kevin waited until everyone was like we’re gonna do this and then okay now I can jump on board there.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> If you think you guys were talking about it for a long time let me tell you here at SitePoint Headquarters we were talking about it for years and years, and it was very similar that we thought it was a good idea but I wasn’t gonna make it happen by myself, so I owe a great debt to our man Brad Williams for actually making something happen and giving me no choice but to sign on or have it happen without me.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> It’s funny because when you listen to a podcast you’re like hey this isn’t &#8212; this sounds like it would be pretty easy to do, get a couple people together that enjoy a topic and just talk, well it’s really not quite that easy, like you get on there and it’s very easy, and I’m sure if you go back to our first handful of podcasts and listen there’s probably a lot of um’s and ands and silent awkward pauses which, you know, Karn and Carl are great at chopping those out so they may not be as obvious, but we’ve obviously gotten better over time just getting to know each other, getting more comfortable around each other and then really realizing what all does go into a podcast. I mean obviously it’s much easier for us now, but back when we first started I mean it was every episode was a lot of preparation.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, and it’s worth noting that it’s a volunteer team of six behind this not just the faces, so to speak, Kevin, myself, Brad and Stephan, but also Carl Longnecker and Karn Broad, our editors and producers, and they edit the show every week so they alternate, they trade off.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> They do a great job.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> And they invest probably about as much time as any of us invest in it to put it up there and make it sound right, and then we have a transcriptionist on top of that.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Kelley Johnson.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> But that person’s not volunteer, so not in the volunteer team, but it’s a seven person outfit.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Stephan, we haven’t heard a lot from you here today, but I would say that is typical of your contribution to the SitePoint Podcast. I remember having a talk with Shayne our marketing manager at the time, and he was in the chat room a little bit earlier, and Shayne said you know that guy Stephan, make sure he doesn’t get away because he doesn’t say a lot but when he says something it is gold.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> (Laughs)</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> I keep little notes of when I’m gonna jump in and say something funny (laughter), no, I’m just kidding. I like to listen because I learn a lot from a lot of our guests and when we interview people, and I learn a lot from Brad and Kevin and Patrick, I learn a lot about communities from you, so I like to jump in when I know something and I don’t know a lot, so (laughs).</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So the best way to listen to the SitePoint Podcast is to get yourself a front row seat as a co-host.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> There you go, yeah, exactly.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> You get it a couple days early!</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I think one of the great things about the show for me has been getting to know you guys better, I knew Brad a fair amount, Stephan pretty well, I knew Stephan really well, and just getting to know Brad and especially Kevin, I got to know Kevin better which is one of the highlights of being a part of this whole thing for me because it’s funny because I was at SitePoint for like eight years before we started this, I was on the staff, forum staff, and I really couldn’t tell you much about Kevin; that’s not anybody’s fault it’s just that we’re different circles, right, Kevin is technical officer, writer, does all this other stuff, he’s not really in the forums in the staff area, all that much is not his responsibility. So, yeah, it’s been a lot of fun I think and, you know, it’s an eclectic group.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So I don’t know, has it been everything you hoped it would be going in, I know it has been for me.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> Yeah, the bar was low for me.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I had low expectations so (laughter).</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> It’ll never last. It’ll never last.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> I’ve enjoyed it a lot too. I mean it kind of goes back to what Stephan said, like we don’t know everything about all the topics but generally at least one of us knows something, hi Andrew. But it’s great when we get somebody on that I don’t know anything about, or much, and then I come out of there actually knowing quite a bit or even being excited about a topic that I really had no idea about, so we learn as much from doing this show I think as our listeners do so that’s why I think it’s gone on as long as it has, and I hope it goes on just, you know, I hope we’re doing episode 200 in a couple years.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So, yeah, what’s been the highlight, let’s go down the line, what’s been the highlight for you in our 100 episodes?</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> All of them. I really enjoyed doing the show at BlogWorld Expo, I thought that was cool getting to do a bunch of shows and sitting around and talking and getting to know each because we’d never met in person all of us in the same area, so that was fun. That was a highlight for me. As far as regular shows, man, I got a bad memory, I can’t remember last week!</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> BlogWorld Expo is a great highlight, I think you may have stolen Patrick’s; Patrick what’s yours?</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I enjoy our news shows every other week, I think it’s a fun thing that we do, it’s not totally work, it’s spending a fun hour or two talking about the news and it helps me stay updated and informed. Highlight-wise, I think that BlogWorld Expo obviously stands out just because it’s the first time we all four met in person so I think that’s meaningful but that’s kind of the copout answer, right, because that <em>should</em> be a highlight. WordCamp Raleigh doing the first live show was fun, Kevin wasn’t there so it wasn’t a total highlight. As far as my guests, Gary Vaynerchuck, Paul Boag, Derek Powazek, kind of three interviews that stand out to me that were really good and really fun to talk to and very informative.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Brad?</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Yeah, BlogWorld, is that what we’re all saying? (Laughter) No, that was definitely a good one. I think I definitely enjoy doing the shows, for me probably one of the highlights is doing some of the one-on-one interviews I’ve done, and nothing against you guys, but before the Podcast I’d never done a podcast interview or a radio interview, nothing like one-on-one where I was the interviewer. In fact, Matt Mullenweg was the first interview I ever did, I don’t even think he knows that, but so it’s fun doing it because to prep doing a one-on-one interview is completely different than a group chat or a group interview because when you do a group interview you can expect your co-hosts to kind of also have a lot of questions and bail you out if there’s some awkward silence, but when it’s one-on-one it’s all on you, so I’ve had a lot of fun doing those and I hope to start doing a lot more throughout this year and next year, so it’s been fun for me.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> My highlight has been all of those moments where we’ve gone off script. For those who don’t know, we prepare sort of a rundown of the news stories and the major links that we’re gonna talk about in each episode, we usually do that in the 24 to 48 hours before we actually record. But every once in a while either there hasn’t been a lot of news that week and that script is looking a bit thin or one of us just hasn’t had the time to get on top of doing that, and we end up just getting together and chatting about whatever’s on our mind that particular day, that particular hour, and that to me has led to some of the most spontaneous and fun and exciting moments that I’ve ever had in all my time working on the Web, so thank you guys for that. I’d have to agree, Brad, though that some of our one-on-one interviews also are a big highlight for me; it never ceases to amaze me how much people like Chris Wilson and Jeff Veen and Matt Mullenweg and Jina Bolton and all of the people we’ve spoken with today and in the past hundred episodes are willing to say yes when you just drop them an email and say hey would you be on my podcast that you may or may not have ever heard of. That people like that are so giving of their time is such a big reason for why I continue to enjoy working on the Web, and yeah, I just want to thank everyone who’s ever been on this show whether as a co-host or as a guest.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> We can’t forget the .net Awards.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> The .net Awards! Yes.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Oh, my gosh! Do you have it nearby, we’ve never seen it?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Speak amongst yourselves; I’m gonna go get the trophy (laughter).</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> We’ve got a couple chat room questions here; first, how many episodes did it take before you finally felt relaxed about doing them? Stephan in the chat answered “I’m still not relaxed.” You look relaxed.</p><p>Ten episodes? For me anyway, five, ten.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> If you go back and listen to the first few they were stiff, so yeah, I would say like five to ten episodes.</p><p>There it is.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Okay, I’m back. Here it is the .net Awards trophy.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Wow. Is it wood?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> It is plastic, it is black shiny plastic, I’m sure there’s a technical name for it.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Now out of curiosity where was it sitting?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> It was sitting pride of place on the countertop at the front door of SitePoint. So you walk in to SitePoint, you arrive at reception and sitting right between you and the person who welcomes people to SitePoint was this monolith.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Pretty prominent position.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> But it wasn’t alarmed in any way or there’s no GPS tag on that thing, you can just run in and grab that like a football?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I’m not really sure, yeah; I may have set off an alarm.</p><p>Yes, it is very pointy, I was worried getting it back from London when I flew back, I thought maybe airport security would confiscate it as a deadly weapon because it’s very heavy and very pointy. They had to confiscate my nail clippers but left me with this; it says a world about the state of airport security at the moment. (laughter)</p><p>So, I think we need to wrap this up with our host spotlights as usual, this is #100, it only happens once guys, so let’s start with Stephan and work our way down.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> So mine’s kind of goofy but my wife helped me pick this one out, she came across Google’s wedding planning software that they just came out with, it’s <a
href="http://www.google.com/weddings/">Google.com/weddings</a> and it basically is a bunch of tools to plan your wedding when you’re getting ready to get married, and we don’t have any use for it, we’re already married, but just looking at it, it would’ve been really helpful because you have things like Google Docs document formats for like collecting addresses, for your budget, for your Picasa web albums, for your website, I mean it’s pretty neat and it’s all wrapped into one little package, and it’s free from what I can tell, pretty sweet.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> It’s so cute that your wife picked out your spotlight.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> How long has that been happening? (Laughter)</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> She’s the brains behind the operation.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Well, yeah, it seems like a left-field move for Google, but I kind of understand it; ever since I read a blog post by Alex Russell who worked for a long time on the Dojo Toolkit, I forget where he is at the moment, but a big guy in the JavaScript arena. He got married and wrote it was either one massive blog post or a series of posts about <a
href="http://infrequently.org/2008/06/wedding-planning/">the process of planning that wedding</a>, and he had harsh words for the wedding industry, he said basically the wedding industry when you go searching for this stuff online you will find nothing basically, and the wedding industry likes it that way; they like you to have to call a planner who will get you in a room and can pressure sell you on every little step of the process and extract as much money from a couple as possible. Would that echo your experience Stephan?</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> Yeah, you know, a lot of when we looked at our wedding planning a lot of our stuff we just said forget it we’re not gonna hire anybody we’re just gonna do it all ourselves, so I had a Google Docs set up anyway that we shared, I had a bunch of stuff set up, I did the website myself, so it was a lot of work and it would’ve been nice to have some kind of central, and there’s all these websites out there that they say they do nice services, I don’t find it to be all that nice and it’s kind of ugly. I mean I have a Flickr album so why can’t I just use the pictures I have on Flickr, and that was part of it, and so now if I had Google Picnik and all that stuff I could do it all in one place, and no I’m not getting married again. (Laughter)</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I think the secret nightmare of a lot of startups is for Google to go oh yeah we’re gonna do something like that too, and Google sucks all the air out of the room. I would say as someone who has no stake in the wedding industry this seems like a really good thing that there is potentially no industry more set for disruption than the wedding industry, but if I were a part of that tightly wound machine I might be pretty worried, shocked and worried, that Google is moving into this space.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> And don’t forget Google just bought ITA not that long ago.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> The Travel Authority, yeah.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> Yeah, the travel website, so there’s a lot of issues with that because I’m big into ITA and there’s a lot of issues, now Google they’ve silently got their fingers in a lot of stuff so it’s interesting.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, and let this be a lesson, if you make it difficult to interact with your industry Google will come in and take your industry. And I think this is really smart because this is basically a way to get people hooked on their products more or less, it’s wrapped in a fancy wedding package but this is pushing you towards Google sites, Picnik, Google Docs, Picasa, versus Flickr or other competing products, so it’s all in this tight package and if you get married with this stuff chances are you might stick around.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Plus you get Google Analytics from everyone of your guests at the ceremony. Patrick, what is your spotlight?</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Okay, so in my kind of quintessential style I guess is my off-topic fun spotlight, and what it is, is you need to look carefully at this, okay, it’s a specific link to a portion of a video, <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXCxzybwvL0#t=0m12s">the last 20 seconds of a Call of Duty Black Ops game clip</a>. It was posted by actually a SitePoint user, username Crowe, real name Crispian, and in the clip he’s playing Call of Duty Black Ops and something funny happens. If you play the game you’ll think it’s really funny, and I guess I’ll describe it, it’s funnier to watch; basically a crate kills his brother more or less in the game, and it doesn’t sound as funny but if you watch the clip and you look at that close, everyone spend the 20 seconds, it’s hilarious.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> It’s the in-game equivalent of a piano falling on someone’s head in a movie that has nothing to do with pianos or people dying; it’s just in the blink of a moment it’s just like—</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> It’s just splat!</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> (Laughs) Yeah. I had to watch it a couple of times to see what I was looking for, so yes Patrick I do appreciate the spoiler, I think it will help a lot of people spot the funny moment in that clip. Brad, what is your spotlight?</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> My spotlight is a funny little site called <a
href="http://www.ykombinator.com/" title="The Random Startup Generator">YKombinator</a>, and that’s with a K, and basically what it does is generates a random startup for you, so if you want to make a web startup go to this site and it will generate a name for you and a nice little pitch on what your startup is going to do, and then you can enter in your email and subscribe to it. So it’s actually released by YCombinator which is the startup funding company, or I don’t know if they’re a company or they’re a service, but it’s a fun way to kind of show off what they’re doing, so they fund a bunch of small startups and then coach them into becoming a product and pitching to investors, so it’s kind of a fun way to auto-generate a web startup, and honestly the site looks like a lot of kind of web startup sites, you know, the coming soon pages, it definitely has that look and feel.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> See when I first saw this I thought it was a parody poking fun at YCombinator by someone else, but YCombinator themselves did this, well, it speaks of a great sense of humor, it also speaks of a little bit too much time to waste between you and me, ha-ha-ha. Which one did you get? I got NetCloud, a vibrant performance oriented travel Wiki.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> I have PingSense, a unique way of buying staplers and other office supplies.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> (Laughs) Staplers. Respect to whoever put staplers into their random startup generator, that was great. My spotlight is one that I have— The best spotlights are the ones you forget to put on because they become such a daily part of your life that you forget it’s something that everyone isn’t using. So mine is <a
href="http://madeatgloria.com/brewery/silvio/reeder">Reeder for Mac 1.0 beta</a>. I have mentioned in passing previously on this podcast that I had moved my feed reading on my iPad and my iPhone to a product called Reeder, and since that mention Reeder has now created a desktop version, it is in beta but between you and me it is super stable, the only reason it’s in beta is because the developer wants to add a few extra features before he releases it as a paid product. So if you head to the website http://madeatgloria.com/brewery/silvio/reeder, which is with three E’s, I’m posting that in the chat room now for the benefit of those watching. It is kind of a semi-hidden link, if you go to the official Reeder website there is no real easy to find link to this beta because the developer really wants to kind of keep it under wraps until it’s ready for the world at large, but between you and me this is the best desktop feed reader around. What it lacks in features it makes up for in polish for what it does do, and for my money what it does do is everything you need for day-to-day feed reading. It sync with Google Reader so all of your subscriptions and all of your read and unread stories reside in your Google Reader account but you access all of that content through this desktop app Reeder. What it’s missing is organization and subscribing and unsubscribing from feeds, so when you find a new feed that you want to subscribe to you’ll have to go to Google Reader to do that, and I do that with Google Reader’s nice and easy subscribe bookmarklet, but when you want to sit down and actually read some content this is the way you want to do it; Reeder for Mac is excellent, it integrates with all the services you’d expect, be that Delicious or Pinboard, be that Instapaper or Read It Later, all of these different services, Twitter, Facebook, all of these things are built right in and you can pick which ones you actually use and the rest of those buttons disappear from the interface. It’s really slick, really great and I can’t recommend it highly enough even though it is still in beta.</p><p>So that is my #100 spotlight, thank you guys for your #100 spotlights. It is quarter past 1:00, we’ve gone 15 minutes long which to me is a remarkable achievement given how much we had to get through, how many guests we had on; congratulations, guys, we did it.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> Yeah, congrats.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Thank you and congratulations to you guys as well.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> We’re gonna have to do the live stuff a little more often.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, yeah. It’s not bad if we can figure out how to keep the spammers out of the chat room I think we’ll be on to something here.</p><p>Who’s cracked a drink, I see Stephan is saluting the camera with his beverage of choice. We’ve got Coca Cola from Patrick; we’ve got, wow, what is that?</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> It’s a mineral water from Mexico.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> It looks like beer, what a letdown.</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> No, this is the beer.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Oh, you’ve also got the beer (laughs)!</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So you’ve got beer, you’ve got soda, you’ve got a mature mug of tea, and then you’ve got frat boy cup.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, the frat boy cup from Brad.</p><p><strong>Brad:</strong> I’ve got a kegger over here, I don’t know what you guys are doing (laughter). Playing beer pong in between guests (laughter).</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Alright, well once more guys let’s go around the table from right to left, Stephan?</p><p><strong>Stephan:</strong> I’m Stephan Segraves, you can find me online, <a

Be visually minded.</h2><p>Your meeting will fall flat if the designer isn&#8217;t able to start creating mental visual concepts about how the design could start coming together. One way to help create the right atmosphere is to make attractive wireframes. If you are like me and aren&#8217;t a designer, then spend the extra effort to learn about basic design principles. This applies whether they are low or high fidelity, digital or hand-drawn.</p><p
/>Another way to serve these conceptual thinkers is to focus on the overall concepts of the site and how you see it coming to life. There couldn&#8217;t be a better place to employ digital or paper prototypes, if you are familiar with them, to help both of you visualize and discuss.</p><h2>2. Channel creativity.</h2><p> Any quality designer will tell you that the best designs are produced within constraints. Creativity that is not channeled can be debilitating. One way to do this is to always talk openly about site goals, technical limitations, audience, budget, and timeline.<p
/>Designers are visionaries who are thinking in terms of design innovation and will likely keep creating new ideas during the whole design process. These are often great ideas that improve upon your work, but they can also frustrate the scope of the project. Clearly stating the limitations the design is working within can be a relief for everyone.</p><h2>3. Focus on enjoyment.</h2><p> If designers&#8217; jobs are merely to skin wireframes, their motivation will be lackluster, and who could blame them? Talk about where you see people being delighted, surprised, or specifically cared for by the site. Especially if you know the types of people that will be using your site, you can discuss how each personality would benefit individually from the interface experience. This will help them focus their energy, build excitement, and lead to innovative ideas for improvement.</p><h2>4. Break it up.</h2><p> When you can, avoid dumping all of your documents and requirements on the designer at once. This will be overwhelming for both of you and can throw the creative process out of balance.  You&#8217;ll probably end up needing one or two bigger meetings, but it will help if you can have some shorter meetings beforehand where you present sketches, talk about ideas, or talk through specific pages or challenges. When the bigger meetings roll around, you&#8217;ll have less groundwork to lay at the forefront and it will be easier to get momentum built. This process will make the transition to the design phase seamless.</p><h2>5. Make it personal.</h2><p> It makes a world of difference to get to know the designers you&#8217;ll be working with personally. How do they best consume information? What role does emotion play in their decisions? What time of day is their mind most focused to absorb details versus think about the big picture? Do they need to marinate on something awhile to offer feedback or is it more instantaneous? Do they need coffee before your meetings? The more you can find out, the better you can personalize your projects with them to everyone&#8217;s benefit.</p><h3>A note for the one-person shops</h3><p>If you happen to be a one-person shop, where you are developing the strategy, planning/wireframing, designing, and coding all yourself, these still apply! As a multitalented individual with a heavy task load, make sure to think about the different modes in which you are asking your brain to work. By helping yourself think conceptually, visualizing, using constraints, thinking about enjoyment, and breaking the work up into smaller segments you will be all set for the design phase.</p> <br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

The game is a space-themed platformer with colorful chunky sprites, great animation and sound effects. The developer, Dominic Szablewski, has also released the canvas-based library at <a
href="http://impactjs.com/">ImpactJS.com</a>.</p><p>Biolab is a fine game. In fact, it&#8217;s better than many released in the 80s &hellip; <em>so I&#8217;ve heard</em>.</p><h2><a

However, the game&#8217;s unique in that the mouse controls the direction of the ship as well as its location.</p><p>Unusually, Crystal Galaxy doesn&#8217;t use the HTML5 canvas element. Every sprite is an individual HTML <code>div</code> moved around the screen. It works quickly in all browsers and is even playable in IE6! The authors at <a
href="http://www.effectgames.com/">EffectGames.com</a> also provide free tools and libraries to help you write your own titles.</p><p>Crystal Galaxy is fun and you won&#8217;t be able to resist another go.</p><h2><a

The game is simple: you ride a bicycle over a series of obstacles to reach a goal &#8212; but the realistic gravity and physics make it a serious challenge.</p><p>What makes Canvas Rider more special is the online track editor and the <a

It was written by Flash developer Grant Skinner who was commissioned by Microsoft to create a game which showed off the new technologies in IE9.</p><p>The game works well in most browsers but, as you&#8217;d expect, it&#8217;s best on a fast PC using a browser with native hardware-accelerated graphics.

It lets you create the effect of a matte and frame around your image.</p><p>1. Open up the photograph that you want to frame. Set your Foreground and Background colors to black and white respectively by pressing D on the keyboard.</p><p><a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/clip_image0021.jpg"><img

/></a></p><p>2. Press Ctrl + A (Windows) or Cmd + A (Mac) to put a selection around the whole image, then press Shift + Ctrl + J (Windows) or Shift + Cmd + J (Mac) to put your selection on its own layer.</p><p><img
border="0" alt="2-LayersPalette" src="http://blogs.sitepoint.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2-LayersPalette_thumb1.jpg" width="217" height="234" /></p><p>&#160;</p><p>3. Choose Image &gt; Canvas Size and when the dialog box opens turn on the Relative checkbox and set the Canvas Extension Color to white. Now set the Width and Height for the size of your frame and matte. This is something you might need to try out a few different values with. For the image that I’m working on here, I set the Width and Height to 10 cm.</p><p>&#160;</p><p><img
style="border-right-width: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;padding-top: 0px" border="0" alt="3-CanvasSize" src="http://blogs.sitepoint.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/3-CanvasSize_thumb1.jpg" width="444" height="370" /></p><p>Click OK to add white space around your photo.</p><p>4. Create a new layer below your photo layer. <br
/>(Note the light grey border in these images is used to denote the edge of the Canvas and will not appear in your images.)</p><p><img
style="border-right-width: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;padding-top: 0px" border="0" alt="4-CanvasAdded-NewLayer" src="http://blogs.sitepoint.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/4-CanvasAdded-NewLayer_thumb1.jpg" width="600" height="458" /></p><p>4. Now you’ll draw a selection larger than the photo and this will be the edge of the frame. Select the Rectangular Marquee tool (M) and drag out a rectangular selection as large as you would like your frame to be.</p><p>Note: If you want to move your marquee while you’re dragging it, just hold down the space bar. When you’ve moved it to where you want it, release the Space Bar and continue dragging.</p><p><a

Press X on the keyboard to set your Foreground color to white, and press Alt-Backspace (Windows) or Option-Delete (Mac) to fill this selection with white. Now press Control-D / Command-D to deselect.</p><p>Ok, so nothing appears to change at this point, because you’ve added a white rectangle on top of a white background, but if you look at your layers palette you’ll see the middle layer thumbnail has changed.</p><p>6. Now you’ll add a stroke to the edge of the middle rectangle. Click on the Layer Styles button on the bottom of the Layers Palette and choose Stroke from the drop down menu.</p><p><a

It really depends on how large your image is and how thick you want the stroke to be.</p><p><a

You’ll add some depth now by creating a very subtle inner shadow in the upper left corner of the middle rectangle, so click on the words Inner Shadow on the left hand side of the Layer Style dialog box.</p><p>Set the Opacity to 50% and uncheck the Use Global Light check-box. Set the angle to approximately 140 degrees and set Distance and Size to 10.</p><p>Click OK to add the Stroke and the Inner Shadow.</p><p><img
style="border-right-width: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;padding-top: 0px" border="0" alt="8-InnerShadow" src="http://blogs.sitepoint.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/8-InnerShadow_thumb1.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></p><p>&#160;</p><p>8. On the Layers palette, click on the Create a New Layer icon. This time you’re creating a small matte between your photograph and your frame. Select the Rectangular Marquee tool again and draw a marquee slightly bigger than your photograph.</p><p><a

Now you’ll fill this selection with white by pressing Alt + Backspace / Option + Delete. The press Ctrl + D / Cmd + D to deselect everything. Once again there is nothing new to see in the image because you have added a white box over a white background.</p><p>10. Click on the Add A Layer Style icon on the Layers palette and choose Inner Glow from the drop down menu.</p><p>When the dialog box opens, change the Blend Mode pop-up menu to Normal, lower the Opacity to about 30%, then click on the color swatch and change the glow color to black in the Color Picker.</p><p><a

Click on that layer and then choose Drop Shadow from the Add a Layer Style pop-up menu.</p><p>Set the Opacity to about 30%, turn off the Use Global Light checkbox, increase the Size (which is the softness of the shadow) to 70 pixels, and then click OK. (Note: If you&#8217;re working with low resolution images, decrease the Size setting.)</p><p><a

href="http://www.socialreport.com/">SocialReport</a> is a social dashboard that helps you track all of your social accounts, networks, websites, short links and blogs. It collects activity across all of your networks, then develops a number of reports to help you analyze your social data.</p><p>I tested it out for a few weeks, and here is a look at some of the features.</p><h2>Extensive Data Capture</h2><p><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32092" src="http://blogs.sitepoint.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/social-report1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="419" /></p><p>SocialReport is probably best described as the social data version of Google Analytics. There is so much data measured that I&#8217;d be hard pressed to find a hole in what is covered. Here is a list of some of the data captured in the tool across your connections on various networks:</p><ul><li>Activity</li><li>Demographics (age, gender)</li><li>Engagement</li><li>Locations</li><li>Interests</li><li>Links</li></ul><h2>Rich Visual Data</h2><p><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32093" src="http://blogs.sitepoint.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/social-report2.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="293" /></p><p>If you like line graphs and pie charts, you&#8217;ll love the way the data is presented. Everything is visual, with the ability to show you specific numbers with a mouseover.</p><h2>Many Integration Options</h2><p><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32094" src="http://blogs.sitepoint.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/social-report3.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="386" /></p><p>You can add your accounts at the most popular social networking into SocialReport including:</p><ul><li>Facebook</li><li>Twitter</li><li>LinkedIn</li><li>WordPress</li><li>YouTube</li><li>MySpace</li><li>Google Analytics</li><li>Bit.ly</li></ul><p>The following networks are currently in beta: Bebo, Digg, Flickr, Foursquare, LastFm and Vimeo.</p><h2>Premium Features for All Kinds of Users</h2><p><img
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32095" src="http://blogs.sitepoint.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/social-report4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="350" /></p><p>There are three pricing levels for SocialReport, with added features for the higher priced accounts. Some of the added features include:</p><ul><li>Downloadable Reports</li><li>Campaign Management</li><li>Conversion Tracking</li><li>Contact Management</li><li>Discovery Agents</li></ul><h3>My Take</h3><p>Overall, I love the depth of the data captured, and how it&#8217;s presented.  The service is fairly affordable with a free trial available (you will have to provide a credit card for the free trial).</p><p>There is such as vastness of data available, though, that it&#8217;s a bit challenging at first to figure out what reports to focus on. Ultimately, it&#8217;s just pretty data until you do something with it. You need to have a plan to interpret the data and apply it to your social activities to make a tool like this worthwhile.</p><p>Do you use SocialReport or another similar social dashboard? I&#8217;d love to hear how you use the data collected to improve your social media activities.</p> <br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

Your HTML web application would fail without them &#8212; they&#8217;re the basis of most user data transmissions between the browser and server. You&#8217;ve no doubt read many articles describing the form tags and data validation with HTML5 or JavaScript. However, today we&#8217;ll discuss how to check whether the user has changed form data.</p><h2>Why Check for Form Updates?</h2><p>There are many reasons why you might want to check whether a form has changed. For example, if a user has updated one or more fields but clicks away from the page, you could display an &#8220;updates were not saved&#8221; warning. You could even give them the option to save the data (via Ajax). Alternatively, if no updates are made, your application&#8217;s efficiency could be improved by not attempting to validate or re-save the data on the server.</p><h2>The JavaScript OnChange Event &#8212; and Why It Can&#8217;t Be Used</h2><p>You can attach a JavaScript onchange event handler to any HTML form element. While that appears to be a viable method &#8212; and I&#8217;ve seen used elsewhere &#8212; there are a number of problems with the approach:</p><ul><li>If the user changes a value then changes it back, the application will still think an update has occurred.</li><li>If a form value is updated using JavaScript, the onchange event handler won&#8217;t be fired.</li><li>Adding onchange handlers to every element on a large forms incurs a browser processing overhead.</li><li>If elements are added to or removed from the form you will need to attach and detach event handlers accordingly.</li><li>The onchange event for checkboxes and radio buttons do not work as expected in a certain browser. <em>(I suspect you can guess which one!)</em></li><li>There&#8217;s a far easier method…</li></ul><h2>Comparing Default Values</h2><p>Fortunately, we don&#8217;t need to go through the rigmarole of complex event handling. Every form element has a default value associated with its object, i.e., the data the form control showed when the page loaded. This can be checked against the current value to discover whether a change has been made.</p><p>Unfortunately, the default value properties differ between form element types…</p><h2>Textual &lt;input&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt; Fields</h2><p>Let&#8217;s start with the easy elements. All <code>textarea</code> and <code>input</code> tags which are not &#8220;checkbox&#8221; or &#8220;radio&#8221; types have a defaultValue property. We can compare this string against the current value to determine whether a change has occurred, e.g.:</p><pre><code>
&lt;!-- name input --&gt;
&lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name" value="Jonny Dough" /&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var name = document.getElementById("name");
if (name.value != name.defaultValue) alert("#name has changed");
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre><div
class="admonition note"><div
class="notetitle"><strong>note: </strong>New HTML5 input types</div><p>If you&#8217;re using HTML4 or XHTML, your text input types will either be &#8220;text,&#8221; &#8220;hidden,&#8221; &#8220;password&#8221; or &#8220;file.&#8221; The new types introduced in HTML5 also have a defaultValue property and can be inspected in the same way. This includes email, tel, url, range, date, color, and search.</p></div><h2>Checkboxes and Radio Buttons</h2><p>Checkboxes and radio buttons have a defaultChecked property. This will either be true or false and it can be compared against the element&#8217;s checked property, e.g.:</p><pre><code>
&lt;!-- newsletter opt-in --&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="optin" name="optin" checked="checked" /&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var optin = document.getElementById("optin");
if (optin.checked != optin.defaultChecked) alert("#optin has changed");
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre><p>Note that checkboxes and radio buttons also have a defaultValue property, but it&#8217;s whatever was assigned to the value attribute &#8212; not the current state of the button.</p><h2>Drop-down &lt;select&gt; Boxes</h2><p>If you&#8217;re using a <code>select</code> box, it&#8217;ll most probably be one which allows the user to choose a single item from a drop-down list.</p><p>Here&#8217;s where it gets a little complicated. The select box itself does not provide a default value property, but we can inspect its (array-like) collection of <code>option</code> elements. When the page is loaded, the option with a &#8216;selected&#8217; attribute has its defaultSelected property set to true.</p><p>We can retrieve the currently selected option&#8217;s index number from the select node&#8217;s selectedIndex property. Therefore, if that option has it&#8217;s defaultSelected set to false, the select box must have changed, e.g.:</p><pre><code>
&lt;!-- job title select box --&gt;
&lt;select id="job" name="job"&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;web designer&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option selected="selected"&gt;web developer&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;graphic artist&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;IT professional&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;other&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var job = document.getElementById("job");
if (!job.options[job.selectedIndex].defaultSelected) alert("#job has changed");
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre><p>This code will work for any single-choice select box where one option has a &#8216;selected&#8217; attribute. Unfortunately, there are a number of catches:</p><ul><li>If no options have a &#8216;selected&#8217; attribute, the browser will default to the first &#8212; but it&#8217;s defaultSelected property will be false.</li><li>If two or more options have a &#8216;selected&#8217; attribute (illogical, but possible), all will have the defaultSelected property set to true, but the browser can only default to the last one.</li><li>A multiple <code>select</code> box allows the user to highlight any number of options:</li></ul><pre><code>
&lt;!-- skills multi-select box --&gt;
&lt;select id="skills" name="skills" multiple="multiple"&gt;
	&lt;option selected="selected"&gt;HTML&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option selected="selected"&gt;CSS&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option selected="selected"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/option&gt;
	&lt;option&gt;PHP&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre><p>Multiple-choice select boxes are not popular &#8212; probably because a series of checkboxes offers a more user-friendly interface. However, when they are used, more than one <code>option</code> can have its defaultSelected property set to true. The select node&#8217;s selectedIndex property is not valid so we must loop through each option in turn to discover whether its selected property matches the defaultSelected property.</p><p>The following code will check for changes to any select box no matter how the options are defined:</p><pre><code>
var
	skills = document.getElementById("skills"),
	c = false, def = 0, o, ol, opt;
for (o = 0, ol = n.options.length; o &lt; ol; o++) {
	opt = skills.options[o];
	c = c || (opt.selected != opt.defaultSelected);
	if (opt.defaultSelected) def = o;
}
if (c &amp;&amp; !skills.multiple) c = (def != skills.selectedIndex);
if (c) alert("#skills has changed");
</code></pre><p>That&#8217;s how you check whether any form element has changed.</p><p>But wouldn&#8217;t it be great if we had a generic, reusable JavaScript function which could detect changes to any form, worked in all browsers and didn&#8217;t require a chunky library?

They may be contacting you for more information, or if they’re very impressed, to hire you for your services. All going to plan, your contact page will be something they will actively seek out on your site. So what should information should appear on your contact page and what information should you be attempting to get from your visitors through your web form?</p><p>Let’s start with the blatantly obvious. You should have a phone number and an email address on your contact page. A postal address is required if visitors want to meet with you and also to provide a sense of security that there is a real and physical address that your are operating from. Some designers place this sort of contact information in the footer of every page, as well as on the contact page. I believe in making things as easy as possible for the visitor, and if they can find what they want quickly and easily in the footer of any page they visit, that can only be a good thing.</p><p>Google and Bing maps are easy to embed on any page and certainly make it easier for potential clients to physically find you if necessary. These maps also allow you to provide driving directions from where they are to where you are and are just another small element that improves your visitor’s experience.</p><p>If you’re an online social butterfly, don’t forget to add buttons to let people know where you are on Facebook, Twitter, Gowalla or whatever your social network of choice.</p><p>When creating a form for your visitors to contact you, make sure that you are collecting all the information that YOU need from them, such as their contact details, what they are are contacting you about. Depending on what type of service you offer, you may need to add extra fields, check boxes, radio buttons or drop down menus to your contact form. For example, if someone is inquiring about the costs of your design services, you might offer a drop down box specifying logo design, web design, graphic design.</p><p>If you don’t have a contact page, you are completely missing an opportunity to engage with your visitors, and you are potentially losing clients. They are not difficult to put together, and below I’ve collected some examples to provide a bit of inspiration if you’re not sure where to start.</p><p><a

This means focusing all your attention on delivering the client’s project, and then suddenly realizing once you’ve done so that you need to sell another job to keep the business afloat. It’s always a feast or a famine. How can you avoid this trap? By having a range of regular, repeat <em>underpinning clients</em>.</p><p>When I took over one midsized web design business, I reviewed the client base and found that a single client represented 33% of that business’s revenue. While this client was big, and a great relationship had been established—<em>and</em> it garnered us a lot of press coverage—I saw that client as our biggest risk. If they left us, the business was in real trouble.</p><p>Of course, as a large organization, it was always being approached by advertising agencies and other web companies who wanted a piece of the pie. Additionally, because it was a large client, there was the added risk of it being difficult to control.</p><h3>More Clients, Less Risk</h3><p>While I didn’t want to reduce the business we received from that client, I did want to expand our underpinning client base. Over the ensuing months, we continued to service this client very well, but we set about building other underpinning clients to provide greater stability and stronger foundations, removing our new web business from such a precarious position.</p><p>The underpinning client is part of a stable of clients that give you regular, consistent work that keeps the rent paid and the wages bill in check. It also gives you the opportunity to spend more time winning work. You spend less time on selling bread-and-butter jobs, and can dedicate your time to performing strategic tasks for your business. In short, underpinning clients provide a foundation for solid future growth.</p><h3>Building Solid Relationships</h3><p>As you complete your first project for any client, you should be assessing their needs, and looking for additional ways to work with them. Some—but not all—of those clients will continue to work with you, and they may well become valuable underpinning clients for your business. For those that do, you have the benefit of knowing the clients and their business, and you’re confident that you can work well together and rely on each other.</p><p>Undoubtedly, you’ll also receive great references from these clients—and that’s crucial. When another prospect wants to speak to your existing clients about your work, you can refer them to your underpinning clients, and be sure to receive a fabulous rap. Gradually, you’ll expand your underpinning client base, giving your business the foundations for future growth.</p><p>So which clients are most likely to become your underpinning clients? They typically have an organizational mentality of outsourcing work to experts, and ongoing, complex needs. Do you know any companies that fit the bill? Perhaps you should make contact.</p> <br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2010/12/16/tutorial-introduction-to-unit-testing-in-php-with-phpunit/">Introduction to Unit Testing in PHP with PHPUnit</a> and <a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2011/01/20/be-more-asssertive-getting-to-know-phpunits-assertions/">Getting to Know PHPUnit’s Assertions</a>), I’ve walked you through some of the steps you can take to test your application. I showed you how, with the help of PHPUnit, you can write tests that are as simple or as complex as you need to ensure quality.</p><p>By now, I hope you understand the importance of having a good set of unit tests. You know that, with those firmly in hand, you can change large parts of your application at will and be sure that the result will match 100%. In this third part of the series, I’m going to explore two features that are a bit more advanced, so they might not show up in your everyday unit-testing practice.</p><p>PHPUnit has lots of advanced features that can be amazingly helpful when that special case comes around. This includes extending the framework itself, making test suites, building static datasets, and the focus of this article: <strong>annotations</strong> and <strong>mocking</strong>. Don’t worry if you’re unsure what either of these are; I’m here to help. I trust by the end that you’ll see how these two features can be useful to both you and your tests.</p><h2>Annotations</h2><p>If you’ve ever read a book or taken a note, you’ll be familiar with the idea of annotations. In the strictest sense, even the comments you put on your tests can be considered annotations. For example:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
class MyTestClass extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
/**
* Testing the answer to “do you love unit tests?”
*/
public function testDoYouLoveUnitTests()
{
$love = true;
$this-&gt;assertTrue($love);
}
}
?&gt;</code></pre><p>In the above example, you can see the simple comment block above the function definition. If you’ve been around PHP for any length of time, you’ve no doubt seen all sorts of commenting styles. This example is a “best practice” that several popular IDEs will use when inserting a comment.</p><p>There’s nothing magical about it, and a normal <code>/* */</code> or <code>//</code> will do just fine if you really want them. The trick comes when PHPUnit comes into the picture. Using the comment style from our example lets PHPUnit take some interesting actions for you automatically.</p><p>PHPUnit has a set of <strong>annotations</strong> you can use, both in your actual tests and in test generation—that’s right, it can do some of the hard work for you.</p><p>PHP lacks a way to parse the comments directly, so PHPUnit has its own tool that looks for certain phrases and characters to match. We’ll start with one of the more handy features—the annotations helping out in test generation. Let’s start with a sample class that does some basic math:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
class MyMathClass
{
/**
* Add two given values together and return sum
*/
public function addValues($a,$b)
{
return $a+$b;
}
}
?&gt;</code></pre><p>Easy, right? I’m keeping it to a basic one-method class because I want you to be sure to catch everything going on.</p><p>With this basic class, we want to be sure the laws of physics and number theory don’t ever change. So we want to write a test. Sure, we can write some code and knock the test out quickly, but why do that when we can be lazy and have PHPUnit do it for us?</p><p>Thanks to the <strong>Skeleton Generator</strong>, we can point it at the class and it’ll do its best to make us a test.</p><p>Since it’s just a part of the normal PHPUnit functionality, we just call <code>phpunit</code>, but with a special flag. Let’s save our simple class above in a local directory file called <code>MyMathClass.php</code>. To use the Skeleton Generator, just point it at the class file:</p><pre><code>./phpunit –skeleton-test MyMathClass</code></pre><p>A test file will be spit out the other side—MyMathClassTest.php—containing:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
require_once '/path/to/MyMathClass.php';
/**
* Test class for MyMathClass.
* Generated by PHPUnit on 2011-02-07 at 12:22:07.
*/
class MyMathClassTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
/**
* @var MyMathClass
*/
protected $object;
/**
* Sets up the fixture, for example, opens a network connection.
* This method is called before a test is executed.
*/
protected function setUp()
{
$this-&gt;object = new MyMathClass;
}
/**
* Tears down the fixture, for example, closes a network connection.
* This method is called after a test is executed.
*/
protected function tearDown()
{
}
/**
* @todo Implement testAddValues().
*/
public function testAddValues()
{
// Remove the following lines when you implement this test.
$this-&gt;markTestIncomplete(
'This test has not been implemented yet.'
);
}
}
?&gt;</code></pre><p>As you can see, it generates a lot of the basic methods and properties you might need.</p><p>Yet, it does have some limitations. The generator sees that you have a custom method in there (<code>addValues</code>), but it doesn’t know what it does. Sure, our test is super simple, and it might be able to parse it and figure it out, but what about some of those other super-complex methods you have in your application.</p><p>I know I wouldn’t want an automated tool trying to guess functionality and accidentally deleting my entire database in the process. No, PHPUnit’s smarter than that, taking the easy road: it makes you define it and marks it incomplete.</p><p>For a large class, this could save you loads of time typing out each of the methods and generic test and class related details. Inside the annotations functionality, though, there’s a hidden gem that can make it all even easier.</p><p>With the help of the <code>@assert</code> annotation, you can tell PHPUnit a bit about what’s inside your methods. Let’s take another look at our <code>addValues</code> method:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
class MyMathClass
{
/**
* Add two given values together and return sum
* @assert (1,2) == 3
*/
public function addValues($a,$b)
{
return $a+$b;
}
}
?&gt;</code></pre><p>If we run our <code>phpunit –skeleton-test</code> command again, you’ll notice a difference in the file it creates for the test. Take a look at the last method:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
/**
* Generated from @assert (1,2) == 3.
*/
public function testAddValues()
{
$this-&gt;assertEquals(
3,
$this-&gt;object-&gt;addValues(1,2)
);
}
?&gt;</code></pre><p>All of a sudden, PHPUnit has X-ray vision and can look inside your method! Well, sort of.</p><p>Obviously, it can generate a test like this because we told it what the test was supposed to do. You can use the <code>@assert</code> annotation with most of the logic kinds of evaluations: equals, greater than, same, less than or equal to, and so forth.</p><p>You can even stack them to have multiple assertions in your test. It’s limited to values and constants, though—you can’t use it to magically create objects in the generated test.</p><p>Another handy annotation is <code>@dataProvider</code>, an easy way to push a standard set of data into your tests so that you always know what you’re working with.</p><p>Clear as mud? Let me give you an example.</p><p>We’ll test the functionality of an application with methods that rely only on input. That is to say, there’s no external XML files or databases it can pull the sample data from. Instead, we need a way to define a data set that all the tests can use.</p><p>One option is to define a test property with some sample data in it and use it each time, but the <code>@dataProvider</code> annotation makes it even simpler.</p><p>Let’s stick with our simple addValues method in our <code>MyMathClass</code> class. This time, though, we’re going to introduce a new item—a simple data set replacing our hard-coded values:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
/**
* Data provider for test methods below
*/
public static function provider()
{
return array(
array(1,2,3),
array(4,2,6),
array(1,5,7)
);
}
/**
* Testing addValues returns sum of two values
* @dataProvider provider
*/
public function testAddValues($a,$b,$sum)
{
$this-&gt;assertEquals(
$sum,
$this-&gt;object-&gt;addValues($a,$b)
);
}
?&gt;</code></pre><p>The major addition to our test is the <code>provider</code> method. Couple that with the <code>@dataProvider</code> annotation, and some fun happens.</p><p>For each of those values in the array returned from provider, the test method is executed. This lets you check multiple sets of data against one test quite easily. The values are returned back into their corresponding parameters in the <code>testAddValues</code> method: array index <code>0</code> to <code>$a</code>, array index <code>1</code> to <code>$b</code>, and so on.</p><p>The first two sets of data in my return array will pass just fine, but it seems I sometimes have a problem with addition, and my last data set is wrong: 1 + 5 does not equal 7. This shows that the data doesn’t always have to make the test pass.</p><p>Sometimes it makes more sense to have “bad” data in the provider. This could be useful in test-driven development when you know the data it should respond to correctly, but there’s no support for it yet.</p><p>These are just two of the handy annotations you can use in your testing. There’s quite a few others (you can find them in the <a
href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/appendixes.annotations.html">PHPUnit manual</a>) that do some really cool stuff:</p><ul><li>The <code>@expectedException</code> annotation watches for an exception to be thrown. If it’s not, the test fails.</li><li>The <code>@covers</code> annotation can be useful for those worried about code coverage numbers and trying to be sure every bit of code is represented—even if one test covers three different methods effectively.</li><li>You can also use <code>@depends</code> to define relationships between your tests, if you require that the test the method relies on has passed. If it doesn’t, the following test is skipped.</li></ul><h2>Mocking</h2><p>From here, we move on to the second more advanced topic: <strong>mocking</strong>.</p><p>This feature is also called stubbing or test doubles. This one’s a little trickier than the annotations, so will take a bit more explaining.</p><p>Just as before, we’ll set up a simple situation to gain a feel for what mocking has to offer. First, though, I’ll explain a bit of what mocking is. For those unfamiliar with the term, it comes from the practice of “mocking up” a test or sample version of an item.</p><p>With PHPUnit’s mocking functionality, you make something that looks like the full object but, when you take a specific action, it only produces one result.</p><p>It’ll make more sense if we just look at an example class and test. For our example, we’re going to be working with a database connection.</p><p>Usually, the database is happy-go-lucky and queries return in under a second. There’s one query, though, that takes up so many resources that it’s just not worth running every time. It’s infamous for making scripts run long and can delay the execution of your unit tests (possibly leading to a delay in deployment).</p><p>Thankfully, mocking can come to the rescue and set up a “mock object” for that method. Here’s the class:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
class Database
{
/**
* This query always takes a really long time
*/
public function reallyLongTime()
{
// database query would return into $results
$results = array(
array(1,'test','foo value')
);
sleep(100);
return $results;
}
}
?&gt;</code></pre><p>Simple stuff, really—it’s a basic class to define a method for running a query that could take a while.</p><p>For the sake of example, I’ve abbreviated this to a return statement. See that <code>sleep</code> call I tossed in there? That’s so we can more easily tell that we’re using the mock object instead of the real one. It simulates the delay in execution. Now, on to the fun part—the test.</p><p>I’ll explain the various pieces after the code:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
require_once '/path/to/Database.php';
class DatabaseTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
private $db = null;
public function setUp()
{
$this-&gt;db = new Database();
}
public function tearDown()
{
unset($this-&gt;db);
}
/**
* Test that the "really long query" always returns values
*/
public function testReallyLongReturn()
{
$mock = $this-&gt;getMock('Database');
$result = array(
array(1,'foo','bar test')
);
$mock-&gt;expects($this-&gt;any())
-&gt;method('reallyLongTime')
-&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue($result));
$return = $mock-&gt;reallyLongTime();
$this-&gt;assertGreaterThan(0,count($return));
}
}
?&gt;</code></pre><p>There’s a few new calls being made here; the easiest to spot is the <code>getMock</code> method the PHPUnit test case object includes. This method makes a call to create a pseudo-version of the object in question. In this case, it’s making a mock <code>Database</code> object that we can use in our test.</p><p>Technically, this object can be used like any other. You can call other methods on it and have them return just like they would normally. The mocking functionality makes it easier to override that, though.</p><p>For our long running query example, we’re making a mock object and overriding the <code>reallyLongTime</code> method for our own purposes. These few lines are the real key:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
$mock-&gt;expects($this-&gt;any())
-&gt;method('reallyLongTime')
-&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue($result));
?&gt;</code></pre><p>These three lines tell the mock object that anytime the <code>reallyLongTime</code> method is called on it, it should go ahead and return the value in <code>$result</code> instead. This bypasses the super-long wait time, and you’re still able to test and be sure the contents are returned correctly.</p><p>Then, if someday you find out about the magic of indexes and caching, and you want to switch over to the actual object, it’s a snap. You can then call the <code>reallyLongTime</code> method on the mock object and retrieve your predefined result set.</p><p>There’s lots of advanced fun to be had with the mocking functionality, including the use of the handy <strong>MockBuilder</strong>. It lets you make some calls that a basic mock doesn’t. In our example below, you can see how to create a new mocked object that doesn’t use the class’s constructor, as well as turns off any autoloading that might be in the works:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
public function testReallyLongRunBuilder()
{
$stub = $this-&gt;getMockBuilder('Database')
-&gt;setMethods(array(
'reallyLongTime'
))
-&gt;disableAutoload()
-&gt;disableOriginalConstructor()
-&gt;getMock();
$result = array(array(1,'foo','bar test'));
$stub-&gt;expects($this-&gt;any())
-&gt;method('reallyLongTime')
-&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue($result));
$this-&gt;assertGreaterThan(0,count($return));
}
?&gt;</code></pre><p>This works similarly to our previous examples, with the exception of those two new methods in there: <code>disableAutoload</code> and <code>disableOriginalConstructor</code>. Thankfully, they’re fairly descriptive about what they do.</p><p>There are also several other return types besides <code>returnValue</code> technique. You can have the value returned from a callback (a PHP function or a custom one), return a series of results on consecutive calls to the mock object, and even throw an exception.</p><p>The with method can be used to define what kind of input the mocked method can take (and can include some type checking too). For example:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
/**
* Testing enforcing the type to "array" like the "enforceTypes"
* method does via type hinting
*/
public function ttestReallyLongRunBuilderConstraint()
{
$stub = $this-&gt;getMock('Database',array('reallyLongTime'));
$stub-&gt;expects($this-&gt;any())
-&gt;method('reallyLongTime')
-&gt;with($this-&gt;isType('array'));
$arr = array('test');
$this-&gt;assertTrue($stub-&gt;reallyLongRun($arr));
}
?&gt;</code></pre><p>In this case, the test would pass because I’m calling <code>reallyLongRun</code> with an array (checked with the <code>isTyp</code>e call). If I were to call it on the stub with a string, PHPUnit would toss an error.</p><p>If you ever find yourself needing to mock a class working with files on the local file system, PHPUnit will be unable to do it for you; however, they do recommend the <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/bovigo/wiki/vfsStream">vfsStream</a> stream wrapper that can act as a go-between and simulate a file system.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>I’ve given you a taste of two of the more powerful features that PHPUnit has to offer apart from normal day-to-day testing routines.</p><p><strong>Annotations</strong> give you more control over how your tests are being run and generated, and <strong>mocking</strong> gives you a powerful way to test how the code should work, without the hassle.</p><p>There’s all sorts of other cool features tucked away in the PHPUnit manual just waiting for discovery. You can generate documentation from your test with <strong>TestDox</strong>, integrate your testing with <strong>Selenium</strong>, and generate code coverage numbers for your application to point you exactly where you need to test.</p><p>From there you can move on to concepts like test-driven design (mentioned in a previous article), which can radically change the way you write applications.</p><p>Unit testing is such an amazingly powerful tool, and having software like PHPUnit makes it an easy and enjoyable experience.</p> <br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

Relevance Posting and Wall Filtering Should Be Less Restrictive</h2><p>The mysterious wall filter and how it all works is an ongoing concern for many who commented on my previous posts.

They could just be tagged &#8216;business page&#8217; or something like that so you&#8217;d know where it came from. Instead I have to constantly switch back and forth between the two as my active account. And suddenly I have two different news feeds to look at? Facebook missed the boat here. Simplify instead of over-complicate.</p></blockquote><p>From <a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2011/02/11/using-facebook-as-your-page/#comment-962207">Roxanne Ready, Ready Designs</a>:</p><blockquote><p>So conversely, if I&#8217;m not using FB as my page but post to my page&#8217;s wall, I&#8217;ll be posting as myself?

href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2011/02/11/using-facebook-as-your-page/#comment-962153">LA_Antley</a>:</p><blockquote><p>…switching from each profile is cumbersome and too likely to cause a cross-post, which may not be easy to correct once it happens.</p></blockquote><p>While these criticisms, suggestions and questions may not reach Facebook, perhaps other SitePoint readers will discover solutions, workarounds and fixes for some of them. Now that we&#8217;re almost a week deep into the upgrade, what have you learned about the new layout? How are you making the new design work for your Page?</p> <br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

Mark July 2014 in your diary as the date HTML5 will finally become an official W3C Recommendation. <em>(Note I&#8217;m referring to HTML5 as a real technology rather than the all-encompassing &#8220;HTML5 is CSS3 is JavaScript is a Flash killer&#8221; marketing nonsense!)</em></p><p>However, there&#8217;s a date approaching which is more important. May 22, 2011 has been confirmed as the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#last-call">&#8220;Last Call&#8221;</a> &#8212; after that time, no new features will be added to the HTML5 specification.</p><p>During the next three years, the W3C will:</p><ol><li>Review all comments. The consortium is expecting considerable feedback from the Last Call and it&#8217;s likely to result in further revisions to the HTML5 specification.</li><li>Create an HTML5 test suite to help vendors fulfill the W3C&#8217;s criteria. An official suite will also help developers build HTML5 content and applications. We will be able to rely on independent implementation results rather than exaggerated feature spin emanating from vendor marketing departments. An <a
href="http://www.w3.org/html/wiki/Testing">early version of the test suite is available now</a>, but it&#8217;s a work in progress and you should not rely on the results.</li></ol><h2>Does the Completion Date Matter?</h2><p>From a pure development perspective, the completion date makes no difference whatsoever. Most browsers already support some HTML5 features. There&#8217;s also no guarantee the feature you want will be fully implemented after July 2014. Developers have always picked technologies with care and, when necessary, used shims, alternative content or graceful degradation for browsers which do not support it. That situation won&#8217;t change no matter what label is slapped on the spec: <a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2010/07/20/5-reasons-why-you-can-use-html5-today/">you can use HTML5 today</a>.</p><p>That said, the completion date may reassure those who consider HTML5 to be vaporware. In software engineering terms, &#8220;draft specification&#8221; equates to <em>&#8220;not ready for production.&#8221;</em> However, when referring to a W3C document, the &#8220;draft&#8221; label means the specification isn&#8217;t necessarily complete, but each feature has been implemented in at least two browsers and may already be viable. The confusion permeates through the industry and is one of the reasons <a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2011/01/25/html5-is-dead-long-live-html/">WHATWG dropped the HTML version number</a>.</p><h2>The Future of HTML</h2><p><img
class="imgright" src="http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/images/tech/472-html5-logo-big.png" alt="HTML5 logo" width="256" height="256" />HTML is an evolving standard. W3C members are already considering improvements for future versions under the working title &#8220;HTML.next.&#8221; So don&#8217;t ignore HTML5 for the next three years &#8212; the industry will have moved to the next iteration by 2014!</p><p>For more information, refer to:</p><ul><li><a

The responsive layout technique has garnered a lot of attention from web developers because it promises to deliver what we’ve been hoping to achieve for some time — building just one version of our content, and having it work beautifully on any device that encounters it. Lots of us have clients who can’t wait to jump on board the Mobile Web bandwagon.</p><p><em>Can</em> we just serve up our entire website with a new mobile-friendly wrapper?

Mobile devices just keep getting better and better — instead of tiny, slow flip-phones, we’re now enjoying  big, colorful screens and fun, intuitive touchscreen interfaces.

None of these people are sitting at a desk; they’re all out and about. It sounds obvious (and of course it <em>is</em> obvious), but it’s still sometimes lost among all the discussions about nifty CSS3 tricks or whether Apple will ever get over its anti-Flash thing.</p><p>People viewing your site on a desktop have the luxury of a big screen, a real keyboard, and a mouse, sure — but they also have the benefit of more time and attention. They’re often at home or in a nice, quiet office; they usually have a stable Internet connection; they are less likely to be distracted by stuff going on around them.</p><p>By comparison, people using a mobile device are often in a hurry. They’re on their way someplace and they want to know which bus stop is nearest; they’re waiting for a friend at a cafe, and want to quickly check the news headlines; they’re at the pub, and they want to settle a debate over which year Diane Keaton won that Oscar.</p><p>What’s more, people on the move are generally still subjected to slower Internet connections. Mobile broadband availability is always improving, but network congestion and signal strength can still affect speed, even in the most well-covered areas. Popular public WiFi networks can suffer from the same issues. And even when these networks <em>are</em> on their best behavior, consuming more mobile data than your phone plan allows can severely punish your hip pocket.</p><p>So, while adding responsive design can help the appearance of your site on some mobile devices, it’s still only one part of the puzzle. In some cases, the best way to serve your mobile visitors might be to create a separate mobile-friendly site — one that eliminates unnecessary distractions, puts mobile-friendly content at the forefront, and avoids fat bandwidth costs.  To achieve that, you’ll need more than just a few media queries.</p><h2 id="how_do_mobile_users_browser_your_site">How Do Mobile Users Browse Your Site?</h2><p>If you’re working on an existing site, chances are that mobile users are already visiting in droves — and that number will only get larger as time goes on. Use your favorite statistics package to see which pages and features of your site are popular among mobile users.  Chances are that you’ll see that the issue of <em>context</em> is reflected in their usage patterns — for example, if you’re working on a venue’s site, contact details, opening hours and directions will be most popular among this group.</p><p>Look also to similar sites to yours — do they have a mobile version of their site? What features do they include or exclude from their mobile sites?  Are these sites successful?  Do you find it easy to navigate these sites on a mobile device?  Try to imagine using these sites on a train, in the street, or at your favorite watering hole; better yet, visit them while you&#8217;re actually doing these activities. Does it seem easy or challenging to use this site in that context?</p><p>Think also about your own favorite mobile sites — step back and take a critical look at them. What is is about these sites that you find most useful? How does navigation work on this site? How does it differ from the desktop version? What’s been excluded or included? Do you miss anything that was omitted?  You’re likely to find that there’s a big difference between the two versions of these sites — everything from the number of items on the homepage, to the arrangement of the navigation, to the use of images and styles.  You might also pick up some neat ideas for the mobile version of your own site — be sure to take copious notes!</p><h2 id="can_media_queries_cut_the_mustard">Can Media Queries Cut the Mustard?</h2><p>Once you have an idea of what belongs on your mobile site, look again at your desktop one. What would you need to add or remove?  Does it still make sense to provide a desktop-like experience for your site? Are there cool techniques you’ve seen around the Web that you’d love to include in your site?  Most importantly — can you achieve all this simply with clever use of stylesheets?</p><p>The answers to these sorts of questions, and more, will help you decide whether to rely only on mobile-friendly styles, or whether to take it a step further. We&#8217;ll bet you, though, that you’ll come up on the side of building a new mobile experience more often than not.</p><p

Part 1 examined <a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/ajax-data-formats-xml-soap-html/">XML, SOAP and HTML</a> and Part 2 discussed <a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/ajax-data-formats-json-jsonp/">JSON and JSONP</a>. Today, we look at custom data formats.</p><p>The most efficient data transmission formats use a minimal number of structural elements to delimit the data. Consider our book data in <a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/ajax-data-formats-xml-soap-html/">XML</a> and <a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/ajax-data-formats-json-jsonp/">JSON</a>. We&#8217;re always expecting six items of data per book, so we could simply use a format such as:</p><pre><code>
The Principles of Beautiful Web Design, 2nd Edition;http://www.sitepoint.com/books/design2/;Jason Beaird;SitePoint;39.95;USD
jQuery: Novice to Ninja;http://www.sitepoint.com/books/jquery1/;JEarle Castledine &amp; Craig Sharkie;SitePoint;29.95;USD
Build Your Own Database Driven Website;http://www.sitepoint.com/books/phpmysql4/;Kevin Yank;SitePoint;39.95;USD
</code></pre><p>Essentially, our data is similar to comma-separated list. We&#8217;ve used carriage returns to delimit books and semi-colons to delimit individual data items (commas couldn&#8217;t be used because they appear in book titles and possibly numeric values). Choosing the right data delimiters is the most important decision we have to make.</p><p>Unlike JSON, we must extract and parse data from the returned string, but this can be achieved quickly and easily using JavaScript&#8217;s string split() method. The following code will convert the data above to an identical JSON format:</p><pre><code>
// convert custom data to an array of JavaScript objects
function ParseBookData(ajaxdata) {
	var book = [], bookData = ajaxdata.split("\n"), bookItem;
	for (var b=0, bl=bookData.length; b &lt; bl; b++) {
		bookItem = bookData[b].split(";");
		book[b] = {
			title: bookItem[0],
			url: bookItem[1],
			author: bookItem[2],
			publisher: bookItem[3],
			price: {
				amount: parseFloat(bookItem[4]),
				currency: bookItem[5]
			}
		};
	}
	return book;
}
var book = ParseBookData(xhr.responseText);
alert(book[0].title); // first book title
alert(book[1].url); // second book URL
</code></pre><p>JavaScript can process the data very quickly &#8212; even if thousands of books are returned. In most cases, you&#8217;ll find that total time for downloading and parsing the data is less than the equivalent JSON-powered Ajax code.</p><p>A custom data format offers several advantages:</p><ul><li>It&#8217;s the most lightweight format and will result in faster Ajax responses.</li><li>The data can be generated quickly by any server-side language without additional formatting libraries.</li><li>It&#8217;s not easy to create a malicious payload.</li></ul><p>But note the disadvantages:</p><ul><li>This may not be a viable solution if the number of object properties are inconsistent. For example, assume our books had optional PDF URLs or prices in multiple currencies. We may require further delimiters and our parsing will become more difficult.</li><li>Your web service may be more limited in scope than one which returns XML or JSON. This won&#8217;t be an issue if you&#8217;re writing services for your own applications but it&#8217;s something to consider if you intend publishing the data for third parties.</li><li>A custom parser must be written for every type of data response.</li><li>The data is not necessarily human-readable.</li><li>You must be absolutely certain that delimiter characters do not appear in the original data. You could check for their existence or consider using delimiters toward the start of the ASCII character set.</li></ul><p>I hope this series of articles has given you a number of Ajax data formatting options to consider. Have you used any other data formats?</p> <br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

The creator of the site refers to these layered compositions as “type follies.” While you create the composition, the app creates fully <acronym>html</acronym> &amp; <acronym>css3</acronym> compliant code. At the time of writing it supports the following <acronym>CSS</acronym> properties: font-family, font-size, color, letter-spacing, word-spacing, font-style, font-weight, text-decoration, text-align, z-index, line-height, width, height, opacity, moz/webkit-transform, text-shadow and font-face.</p><p>The palettes can be moved freely around the screen and you use sliders to change typeface, size, color and spacing. When you’re finished creating, you can save and export your type projects. All projects can be saved in our database or exported as compliant <acronym>CSS/html</acronym>. I found this to be a little clunky at times, with the text occasionally not responding to changes I made on the palettes, but overall it’s a nice visual way to work with type and will be familiar to anyone using image editing software with palettes.</p><p><a

You simply type in a piece of text on the left hand side, make adjustments to color, size, emphasis and spacing using the dropdown menus and sliders, and voila! On the right hand side you’ll see the CSS code which you can then copy and use in your web design.</p><p><strong>Have you used these tools before?

Here, I want to explain  a couple of the ways my business uses social media to our advantage.</p><p>In my organization, we have a Twitter account and a blog for the brand itself. I have my own personal Twitter account, and we encourage our team members to have their own accounts too. We look for people across the team to contribute content to the blog, and we’re always out there doing <a
href="http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2011/02/01/fearless-public-speaking-and-compelling-powerpoint/">public speaking</a> at relevant industry events. We’re always out there, in the mix.</p><p>What’s great about these approaches is that they provide the opportunity to amplify your message: other people can retweet it or link to your blog. We also do a lot of guest appearances on other companies’ blogs; it’s worthwhile looking around and working out who else is out there in your field, then join together to make more noise, garnering more attention than you would otherwise. We did a video for <a
href="http://www.bnet.com/">BNET</a> a few years ago, and it really is a gift that keeps on giving. We still receive contacts from that exposure even now.</p><p>One key way to promote these channels to your contacts is to include your Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social networking details on your business card, website, and everything you do.</p><p>The other benefit of engaging through social media is that these tools make it easy to find out what other people are saying about you, and keep an eye on your reputation within the market. You can take advantage of this in a number of ways: when a prospect asks me what our customers are saying about us, we encourage them to check our @ replies on Twitter as a first step. If people are saying good things about you, let your clients see for themselves.</p><p>Recently, a client asked us for our résumé and references. We sent him the Google search results for our names and a Twitter search for our Twitter usernames—and won the job. The client remarked that the Google search told him far more than we could ever fit on a one-page resume. As this example shows, it’s best to let the market speak for itself.</p><p>Now, that&#8217;s great from a promotional sense, but social media can also help you to manage your business. One of your key tasks as a business owner is to maintain your database of contacts. Traditionally, this was difficult to do: people would move from business to business, and you’d be none the wiser that they’d changed jobs. Your database could quickly become redundant. Using online systems such as LinkedIn, where your contacts maintain their own profiles, solves this problem: when they do move, they can update their details themselves, so you’ll know where your contacts are working at any given time.</p><p>As soon as you see that a contact has moved to another organization, get in touch. Often, they’ll be moving into a role in which they’ll have a need for help from a web design business, so keeping track of your clients as they move around can be a strong business strategy. One of my clients has been using my business’s services for years, across three different employers that he’s worked for. Check your LinkedIn alerts regularly to see who’s moved where, and jump on the phone to those contacts as soon as you can.</p> <br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

Jay and Amber welcome to the show!</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Hey, how you doing? Thanks for having us Patrick.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> It’s great to have you on; we just had you on episode 88 of the podcast, the SitePoint Podcast, which was published November 18th and recorded in mid-October, so in about I guess a span of 12 episodes you’ve made two appearances so that’s pretty good.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> It is good, but you know we’ve been pretty busy since then, so while it’s only 11 podcasts I feel like I’ve aged 11 years since then.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> (Laughs)</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Eleven weeks and 11 years.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> We’re operating in sort of dog time right now.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Totally.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Wow. So this actually might be the last interview you do!</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> It may be. It’s like Benjamin Button.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Yeah, right, we’ve totally contemplated whether we should do the rest of our interviews and events from a beach in Mexico somewhere, so you know, maybe.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Well, authors know that you can’t do that on book sales alone.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> You got that right.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> It’s a lot of work to get that money.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> You still have a job, right Patrick, just want to make sure you didn’t retire on the proceeds of—</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Right, I didn’t retire on the many thousands of dollars that I made. But I feel like I need to put a disclosure at the front of the show here because I am briefly quoted in The Now Revolution and was proud to have been asked to do so, and I’ve lead conference panels with both of you and I like both of you a lot, I want the book to be very successful, and no I haven’t read it myself, knowing both of you as I do I feel confident in saying that I think it will be one of the most important books for this space that will be published this year. So my bias is clear and I guess let’s get started.</p><p>In looking at both of you in considering the interview I did something that I haven’t really done before, I don’t know if that’s good or bad, but I actually read both of your About Me pages and your LinkedIn profiles, all of it, and I found them both really interesting. First, Amber, I wanted to talk about your background a little bit. One of the things that jumped out at me was some of the earliest positions on your LinkedIn profile were charity related, titles like Endowment Campaign Manager, Director of Annual Giving, Director of Philanthropy; and I was curious what pushed you towards that space?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> That’s actually kind of an accidental story. I was actually a music major in college and my first love was the arts, so I got involved in non-profits because I was actually pursuing a career in arts administration. So the first work that I did with the Milwaukee Symphony was basically one of those “show up and give me a job, I don’t care what I have to do” kind of things, and they actually had an opening in the fund raising department. So, I didn’t have a professional background in that but I kind of learned in the trenches, and I very much fell in love with it, so the community building aspect, the volunteer management, you know it’s the soft side of communications and sales I guess for the non-profit industry, so I really enjoyed it.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I hadn’t planned this question but I’m curious now, what does an arts administrator do?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> It’s mostly the operations behind what you would see in like for a symphony orchestra it’s the entire back-end of everything that happens outside of the performances, so it’s raising money for the organization, it’s developing educational programs; it’s all the logistics and operations for the concerts themselves, so it’s running the business side of being in the music industry.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Because art does have a business contrary to what some might think.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> It does believe it or not, it really does.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Art needs the bills paid.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> You got it.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> And then following that you transitioned into more of a traditional marketing position, and I noticed that your role as a marketing and communications director at one company ended, and then the very next month according to your LinkedIn profile you started blogging at Altitude Branding which is now Brass Tack Thinking, and then six months later you’re at Radian6. Is there an interesting story behind that transition from that traditional marketing role to blogger to a company that is really on the cutting edge of measuring the social media space?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Yeah, well, interesting I suppose is subjective, but I can tell you how I got there. Doing the traditional marketing thing in a relatively traditional corporate world it was falling in love with the communications aspect of things all over again that I’d been doing for a long time, but really falling out of love with a lot of the really kind of staid, into my estimation— I was not an officially trained marketer so I took issue with a lot of the ways that “really good marketing” was done. And I cut my teeth on that position for a few years, but I really felt like there was something more, and I’ve always been involved in the online space even when I was doing fundraising stuff. I remember when it was really exciting that we were going to do online fundraising, and I was one of the big advocates for that. So the Web has always been a really important part of what I did, and I decided that I wanted to strike out on my own so that’s what you saw there was I quit my job, and I don’t recommend people do it the way I did it because I did without a plan. I literally woke up one morning and said I can’t do this anymore and I have a different idea, so I walked in on a Friday and quit and the following Monday I filed papers to incorporate my own business which was— Altitude Branding was actually a consultancy right out of the gate, and I was doing mostly communications and branding work because that’s what I knew very well. So I did that and that led into consulting work around the Web and social space, and Radian6 was actually one of my first clients, so several months later they picked me up as a full time employee.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Cool story. So I think that you spoke to this a little bit, but how do you feel that that early background, accidental background in philanthropy, applies or has helped you grow Radian6 and helped people in general that perspective to navigate the social media landscape?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Well, I think in my estimation the community of non-profits and fundraising is very much sort of online community 1.0, building those volunteer organizations and the relationships that you build with donors and the donor cultivation you do over the years is very much, I think, the principles on which I social media is taking root; it’s the idea that you’re there first to establish a relationship with somebody and get to know their purpose and why they care about your company and then the money comes later. And in for profit business we often turn that on its head and say buy from us first and then we’ll care about what you do. So there are a lot of underlying principles I think in the non-profit world that I think are still very, very consistent with the community building, the social media mindset and then mash that together with my love for technology and how I think it powers business and I think it’s actually quite a full circle transition.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s a tremendous point. And really one of the things that I enjoy or have enjoyed about this social media online community, the people who work in this space, it’s a lot of terms, but people in general, the people who are really good at this stuff that have a lot of attention are also very approachable people that are very giving of their time, that share a lot of information such as you and Jay and just looking at the inside of your book and the advance praise you know obviously I see a lot of names here that are well known in this space, people I know and don’t know like Seth Godin and Chris Brogan and Scott Stratten, Maurice Smith and Mitch Joel and Scott Mauney, and so on. I don’t know; it just seems like a lot of professionals in this space are very approachable and easy to access even if they are at the top of the space.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Yeah, that’s right. I think there’s very much a consistent thread of people who really get passionate about the potential for this kind of communication possess sort of the innate attributes in the people; we want to embody, we’re trying to embody the businesses that we want them to become so I think you’re on to something there actually.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Excellent. So, Jay’s wondering “Why am I here?” So, Jay’s it’s your turn now. Now, Jay, you have a Bachelor’s in political science and I had Amber with philanthropy and political and generally I don’t know if people see those things as the same, as much as they should be, but when you were going to school and getting that degree what did Jay Baer want to be?</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> I originally set out to be a journalism major; I was gonna be Bob Woodward, that was the game plan, but took a college class, my very first college class, Intro to Political Science, and had an incredibly amazing teacher who taught us from a very well known book about political consulting from Larry Sabato from University of Virginia and it sort of turned my whole head around and was also the class where I met my future wife, so it was a very important class for me…</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Wow.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> …and changed my major to political science and started in the political consulting realm, I started actually the summer after my freshman year, I started doing political consulting and campaign management. And what I liked about it very similar to what Amber said about philanthropy is that I liked retail politics, right, I liked the ability to win hearts and minds a few at a time, and I also loved the finality of campaigns. The day after the election you’re either super psyched or your super pissed, right, there’s really no— You’re never half elected and I love that part of it and I think that’s why ultimately I gravitated toward digital marketing and social media because you can keep score if you choose to do so, and of course we’ve got a lot of content in The Now Revolution about social media success metrics and tracking, and my background has been on that side of it for a long time.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Cool. And there were a couple of other points in your bio which I thought would be of interest to all listeners, which are web developers, web designers, web masters, and so on, and the first was that you were VP of Marketing for Internet Direct and according to your bio they were the first virtual web hosting company. So in that role essentially from my perspective and quick reading of it we’re talking about the marketing of a brand new or relatively brand new surface, virtual web hosting.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Yeah, it was crazy.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, and at that time how did you set out to market web hosting to small to mid-businesses in those early days?</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> It was such a strange time, I mean we’re talking about ’93, ’94 and literally my partner in that business invented the partitioning algorithm which allowed you to run multiple domains on a single box, before that it was one server, one domain name, and so he figured out how to run multiple domains on a server and so we ended up being in the web hosting business and so I was the marketing and sales guy, and the challenge was at that point nobody even wanted a website, I mean you could almost not even give them away.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> You could give these things away, websites, down the corner give away websites.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> The people who understood, even at the very, very early stage, where this was headed and the power of the Web would pay crazy money, right, because they just really built their whole business around it. So, we primarily sold on features because we could out-feature everybody else in the market because of the way our technology was set up, and so it really became I think our slogan for a while was ‘nothing not included’, so if you were &#8212; if you knew enough to know that you wanted a web hosting company we tried to be the best one out there.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So obviously how most web hosting companies reach people in this day and age is through the Web.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Yeah, it was not really an option for us actually.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So I was curious, what, I mean obviously traditional advertising, business publications, newspapers; how did you go about kind of reaching those people and I guess what was most successful in the mid-90s?</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> We did quite a bit of print. So back in the day we did Internet World, Net Guide, Internet Week, PC Magazine, I ran a lot of full-page magazine ads back in the day. We did quite a bit of booth stuff at major Internet conferences back in that era, and then towards the end of my tenure at Internet Direct we just started to scratch the surface with any sort of online, in fact I bought the very first ad ever run on Ink.com, Ink Magazine’s website, and people sent me mean email for first sullying the content with an advertising banner, so I literally remember sitting there saying, hey, we could get this to animate, right, and like hey it’s a GIF-89A, check it out, we can have the mouse walk across the banner, and like the whole company walked into the office to see the mouse walk across the banner. It was an early days type of a circumstance.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> (Laughs) It’s a great story. Well, do you remember what the first virtual web hosting cost?</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> We originally charged I think it was $189.00 a month, and that would be a plan that right now would be about $9.00 a month.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Okay, okay, well that’s not too bad considering how the Internet deflation works.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> That’s right.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Not bad at all. In addition to being around during those exciting times you also have a background as a web publisher and as the co-founder of azfamily.com, which is a large local focused website, obviously Arizona, and it’s now owned by an independent television KTBK that’s based in Phoenix which was founded in the 1950s. According to your LinkedIn profile the website began in August of ’96 and I started messing around with the Web shortly thereafter and have a general sense of how different a place it was when it came to tools and available software. So, at that time when you were developing this website how did you or your team go about developing it, did you write everything, did you have to create everything; was it as difficult as I think it was?</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Oh, it was. It was crazy. And it was a terrific experience, it was a family owned media conglomerate, they had two TV stations, two magazines and two radio stations, and I sort of was the Internet guy. So we built the site azfamily.com to represent all of those other media outlets, and the smart thing that they did and that I made sure that we adhered to over the years was to have one site as opposed to six different sites, one for each magazine, one for each radio station, so you’re splitting your audience into very small pieces; we managed to get everybody to agree and put their egos aside to build one website. But we built the whole thing in Perl, the entire site was built in Perl with custom built CGI scripts, we built our own content management system, we built our own photo rotations, headline rotations, our own email distribution engine for email newsletters, actually did the initial very first IA, the very first site diagram I did on the back of a paper plate in my back room.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Not even a napkin, with a paper plate.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> A literal paper plate, yep.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> (Laughs) That’s funny. And as you walk through those tools I mean obviously it’s funny to think about it, and I recently was thinking about it with regard to the forum software space and I think how some people take it for granted because I was on Quora recently and I answered a few questions on there and it’s funny, I’ve spent too much time reading and answering questions to the extent of “Will X replace forums?”, “Is Quora the new forums?”, “Why haven’t forums done anything in the past 12 years?” Well, here’s the thing, like if you install forum software from 10 years ago and you install now you should see a tremendous difference, and the same is really true and it’s funny if you consider because even when I was coming up, so to speak, in the late ’90s and I started my really serious stuff in 2000, the tools out there, there just wasn’t much in the way of tools out there; I had static HTML pages, we didn’t have WordPress, we didn’t have anything <em>like</em> WordPress, this was back in the dark ages. And now you have things like CMS for WordPress or Drupal or Expression Engine, or whatever, and then you have all these email marketing suites, MailChimp, and so forth, and all these things people can sign up and have ready for free in about 10 minutes.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> And I think about now, you know, we were doing probably three million pages a month on a site that was 100% homegrown CGI Perl spaghetti code, and to think that we even managed to keep that site online based on what has happened subsequently I look back on them, like I don’t even know how we did it, it’s really the world has changed so much. But, that’s the one thing about technology, right? Everything gets commoditized eventually, which is why so much of what we talked about in the book is not here’s how to operate this tool but here’s how to think about this strategically and have a plan for your business that’s actually tools agnostic because if you’re just chasing tools you’re always just chasing.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, exactly. So you youngsters out there don’t take for granted what you have now as far as—</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Did azfamily.com have any community or interactive features?</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Yeah, we had a lot of discussion boards and it was very much so, as you well know, one of the most successful areas of the site from a pageview generations perspective, I mean people who went into that section looked at an average of 13 pages a session or something like that, and people who didn’t go in that section looked at three, right, so a huge part of the stickiness of the site was all around the forums, and when I read your book it brought back a lot of memories both good and bad of those days. We had somebody one time threaten the life of an on-air talent in the discussion board, one of the TV anchors, and so the FBI came and like wanted our server logs and it was just crazy, crazy days. And I also remember sitting there working all night when we went to 2000, right, and making sure everybody was there in case the website blew up or the world ended; we’d have to be able to put the headline on, if it was Armageddon what would we do?</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah. “You’re now reading this from a bunker; hopefully you have a good connection on that AOL dialup.” That’s funny. And how large of an operation was it when you left, I know you mentioned three million pageviews a month, but as far as staff?</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> We ran it super lean, we had two pieces of business, azfamily was a local contents site and then we also were a web design firm and built sites for other companies in Arizona. When I left I think we had about 20 people, 22, something like that, so not very big.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Wow. Yeah, that’s pretty good though for a website local focused that was started locally and run for four years and I guess sold later.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Yep. Sold to Belo; the whole operation was, not just the site but the whole conglomerate, all the TV stations and the magazines and radio stations were sold to Belo Corporation, which own the Dallas Morning News and a lot of other things, for $350 million or something crazy, of which I saw nothing.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Just to be clear. So let’s talk about the book. Amber, how did <a
href="http://nowrevolutionbook.com/">The Now Revolution</a> come together, did one of you have the idea for it and then contact the other, did Wiley bring you together; how did the whole process kick off?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Well, the famous story is really that Jay and I had both been independently contemplating writing books. And I know that Jay had been talking to the inimitable Scott Stratten for a long time and Scott is a Wiley author and was nice enough to put in a plug for us at Wiley. And I have a couple of friends who were authors over there as well so they had been kind enough to recommend me, so the forces just kind of aligned really well, and Jay was thankfully more persistent and aggressive than I was at the time and he approached me and said I want to write this book but I don’t want to do it alone. And he and I seemed to think along very similar lines with a lot of stuff, we have some different approaches to things but our philosophies are very similar, so he came to me and said I want to write this book and will you write it with me and I said sure. So we put in a proposal and Wiley was crazy enough to tell us that they’d publish it, so I really have to credit Jay with getting the ball rolling here on something that I think we’d both been wanting to do but he had the gumption to actually take the next step.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> And for the collaborative writing process, well I should ask first, I guess you guys wrote the book together at the same time, right?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Yeah, we used Google Docs.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, what tools did you use and how did you efficiently write together?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Well, we weren’t really heavy on the tools, I mean Google Docs came in handy for a lot of the writing and the editing stuff because it was in a central spot, but we got together one day in Arizona and I was out there for some business or whatever, so Jay and I holed up in a room at his old agency for a few hours one day and hammered through an outline and came up with what we thought were the central themes of the book, and we literally divided the books straight down the middle and went off to our respective corners and wrote our faces off and then we traded. So we handed each other the work that we’d done and we edited, added stuff to it, asked questions or whatever, and built on each other’s work, and we went through that similar process a few times throughout the editing; that seemed to work okay for us.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, it’s just interesting for me as an author and I think other people who write with others in general because there are different approaches. I think I read Chris Brogan say something about how he scheduled time with a co-author and they wrote at the same time in the same Google Docs so things would be changing but you’re both sitting in there and writing at the same time, and that does seem a little chaotic but it can work for some I would say.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Well, I’m sure if it works for somebody that’s awesome. (laughs)</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Yeah, I don’t think it would work for us, and we tend to write differently, a different process as well. When we put the book together we each wrote like almost literally the exact same number of words in this book, it’s crazy how it worked out like that, but I figured okay my system is going to be I’m going to write some everyday so I wrote 1,000 words for 21 straight days or something like that, and Amber is much more of a passionate writer, as anybody who’s read her blog can attest, she’s got that it means a lot to her, not that it doesn’t mean a lot to me, but she wears her heart and her beliefs on her sleeve and that’s what makes her such a powerful author. And so Amber sort of when she feels it is like okay here’s 6,000 words, it’s like <em>blah!</em>, just like rushes it out and then doesn’t write until she feels it again, and I’m much more sort of robotic and I just turn on the computer and just write and I’m like okay I’m done for today and that’s it. So, because we’re so different in that regard it would’ve been really, really difficult for us to literally co-author at the same time the way Brogan and Julian Smith do.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, that was a really nice way to say Amber doesn’t write on a schedule. (laughs)</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Yeah, it’s true. Well, he’s absolutely right that I don’t; I actually do really poorly when I try to force myself into writing mode, I’ll sit there and stare at a blank screen. So if I know I have a deadline I don’t blow deadlines but whether that’s 1 o’clock in the morning or 11 o’clock in the morning or whether it’s one hour or a four-hour marathon stretch of writing I just sort of have to tap into it when it hits me, and I don’t work really well on the whole prescribed daily words thing, and so everybody’s got to find what works for them and it managed to all come together in the end.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> The subtitle for The Now Revolution is “7 Shifts to Make Your Business Faster, Smarter and More Social”. And just out of curiosity did you come up with that?</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> (Laughs)</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> (Laughs)</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> That’s a question that doesn’t have a neat and tidy answer.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> (Laughs) Okay, I was just curious because I know with my publisher my subtitle was not fully me I will say.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> I would say that’s probably true in our case as well.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Okay, okay. But there are the 7 shifts, and obviously the book will go into more detail, but just to give us an idea of the contents can you give kind of a quick summary of what the 7 shifts are and Amber maybe you can go first and then you can alternate.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Sure, we can do that. I don’t even know how we came up with seven, I think we just decided we’d come up with as many as we needed until we were done.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> You were in Vegas at the time and needed a lucky number.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Yeah, maybe so, I am not lucky in Vegas. But the first one for us was about culture shift and the importance of &#8212; I think the reason we put that first is because we feel it’s really super important to have culture, mindset and intent sort of set out and all agreed upon before you can really move on any of the strategic or tactical stuff, so that was the first place we started.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> The second one is all about creating a group of people within your company that you can trust and that social media makes hiring and staffing different than it has been in the past, that you’d have to have different people on your team and they have to really be a team, so we have a whole section on personnel and HR.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Right. And the third section actually builds off that one pretty seamlessly and talks about how to organize those teams, so once you’ve actually got people in place that are either in part or wholly focused on doing social media work how exactly do you organize them in a way that helps that scale across your organization and define some functions and bridge the gap between taking social media from a siloed function in a department to actually bringing it across borders and getting some collaborative work involved there, so that’s shift 3.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Shift 4 is all about listening which of course is endemic in the social media world, but we sort of take a different tact on it and talk about specifically what should you be listening for, what are the methods that you can use to tap into conversations about your company or about your brand and then the different types of listening programs that can be put into place in different companies based on their size and needs. So we show different models for setting up listening teams and then what to do with that information; one of the problems that I think is really widespread in social media as we talk today is that people have access to all this information and then they have no idea what to do with that, right, it’s not &#8212; data gathering and learning is not the same thing so we tried to give people a success path for that.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Right, and then we actually talk about, in the realm of what to do with that information; shift 5 actually talks about emphasizing the ability for your company to respond when necessary and actually get out there. The term that’s bandied about in social media is ‘engaging’ but we talk about it from several different perspectives about contributing content to participating to actually harvesting stories internally in social media to empower other employees to actually be able to be those kind of spontaneous spokespeople and unofficial marketing armies, so we talk a little bit about empowering everybody to have a voice and to be responsive when companies need them to be in a realtime business situation.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> The sixth shift is what happens when you do that and it all goes horribly wrong.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> (Laughs)</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Which is the section that Patrick is quoted in, it’s all about social media crisis management and how to handle that and what to do about it and how to make sure it doesn’t occur but if it does what to do next. As we say in the outset of that chapter, “We hope it’s the chapter that you never have to read, but if you do have to read it, it will quickly become your favorite chapter in the whole book.”</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Yep. And the last one is tackling one of everybody’s favorite topics in social media, which is measurement and metrics, so we sort of try to break down that beast into some clear guidelines for what types of goals you can realistically set for your social media activity and then how to decide which metrics and measurements might actually point you toward whether or not you’re being successful. So, we take the big hairy beast of social media measurement and boil it down into a way to sort of pick and choose some very top-line basic metrics that’ll get you where you need to go.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So you talk a little bit, or a lot I should say, about I guess empowering individuals within your company to confidently answer questions themselves online or wherever. And part of that, and I probably know where both of you stand on this and so I just want to just throw it out there anyway, but the idea, the discussion of individuals within companies building brands while at the company that are stronger, or then the company and they take those brands with them, I mean at this stage that ship has sailed, right, is that a part of the shift of The Now Revolution?</p><p>Was that a bad question? Did I say that wrong? It felt like it came out really wrong!</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> It’s a great question; I’ll let Amber take the first crack at it because she was a community manager so sort of lived that circumstance.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Yeah, I mean I think that’s sort of the inevitability I guess of what’s happened online mostly because the days of the official spokesperson really are over, and I’m not sure that they ever really existed as much as we thought that they did, but it was an idea that we really liked to perpetuate. And so nowadays it’s just that we’ve given our employees things like the phone and we’ve given them email and we’ve empowered them with information about our businesses and we want them to be ambassadors for what we do, so it’s a sensible, I think, evolution to empower positions like community managers or even unofficial community managers in the sense that I tend to think that people in companies that are passionate about their role or passionate about their work or passionate about their customers are sort of defacto community managers; salespeople have a community of customers that they service, customer service people have that same community in a different capacity. Even internally people have communities that they need to foster, so I think those kinds of— I think that ideal of having people be able to be nimble and responsive to the needs of a company they’re accelerated by the speed of the Web right now, but I think they’ve always been sort of lurking there and now the Web is a catalyst for making sure that we have to be able to react at speed to those kinds of opportunities.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, it’s funny you talk about giving them the phone and email, it’d be funny if every large company picked one person and took away their telephone and email for a month and then said ‘do work’.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> The Amazon.com product description for the book says that, “The Now Revolution isn’t about how to do social media, instead it outlines how you must retool your organization to make realtime business work for you rather than against you.” So it sounds to me as though this book is really strongly a book about the culture of your organization, is that fair?</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Well, certainly it’s about the culture substantially, but it’s also about the mechanics; we talk a lot about how to create task forces and armies within your company, how to deploy those people, so there’s a lot of HR organizational process, how to make this actually work day-to-day type of insight in the book, but it’s certainly not a here’s the best way to get re-tweet kind of a book.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Right, so there’s some do in there, right?</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Oh, there’s a lot of do, it’s just not hands-on keyboard do, it’s much more the book is for people who are owners, high-level executives or people on the HR side, directors, managers to be like okay I’ve got all these employees, more on the way, how do we actually operationalize social media, which I was reticent to say that because Amber hates that word…</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> (laughter)</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> …but that’s really what we’re talking about, right; how do we take social media from wow, neat, nifty, and make it an integral part of what this business does day-to-day, and that’s why we wrote the book and that’s why we hope that the book is just as valuable five years from now as we think it is today because we tried to put something out there that doesn’t necessarily have a shelf life.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Speaking of culture, I love that you cited ThinkGeek as an example within the book, largely for the culture they have as a group; Amber, what put them on your radar and why are they so special?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Well, I don’t know, there’s an affinity for all of us nerds in this space to love things like what ThinkGeek does. Personally I really want to get— I think it’s ThinkGeek that has this; it’s like a frame for your iPad that’s like an Etch A Sketch.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Awesome. I actually just saw that the other day, it’s funny.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> So very cool. But they just really live and breathe that idea of imparting the culture of your organization into every single individual person, so part of what we cited in the little, brief case study was the fact that one of their first interview questions for new employees is whether they prefer Star Wars or Star Trek. And so even the way that they vet potential employees is true to their sort of mindset, their spirit, their personality, and so right out of the gate they’re sort of guaranteeing that they at least get people there who have the right mindset and place first. You can train for skills and you can train for capabilities but you can’t really train mindset, and so they’ve really embodied that idea of bringing the right people onto the bus, as Jim Collins would say, and then empowering them with the information and tools they need to do their jobs but they’re all kind of on the same page to start with.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> And the Etch A Sketch iPad case is $39.99 on Thinkgeek.com. They also have an iPhone version for $24.99.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Man, that’s so cool, my visa card is cringing in my wallet right now.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> And maybe the coolest thing about is that the back of it is actually a mock of what was on the back of the Etch A Sketch, the little black ridges and all that stuff on the back.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> No kidding? God, see that’s so cool. (laughs)</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> That really is awesome.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Yeah, I actually found a Christmas present for my brother on there last year. He plays the game BioShock and if you’re familiar with that game, which I’m sure some of the listeners are, they have an actual syringe on there from the game like a prop within the game they’re selling it, and yeah, so you could spend hours on that website.</p><p>Now, I have some familiarity with forums and I found a quote on page 149 that was interesting, speaking in relation to crisis management you write that “An FAQ page without a discussion forum runs contrary to the expectations of today’s customers/reporters.” And forum in that usage is really meant to imply any open space where people can discuss an issue. Why is it important to not only make statements about a crisis but also to allow for open discussion that can obviously be rather unflattering? Jay.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Well, I think we feel that people care about companies and how they behave and ways that they historically have not, and the Web gives them the opportunity to do so. People want to see the sausage being made now, and things happen so quickly that if you say alright we’re just going to make a statement about what’s gone on and not allow anybody to respond to that statement in an official capacity; they’re still going to respond but it’s going to be in a public forum where you have no ability to control, right, so if you don’t give people what we call the pressure release valve where they can actually comment on your blog post or comment on your Facebook discussions tab or some other mechanism that you create then they’re going to take it to the public social web, your wall or Twitter or somewhere else where you really have a much harder time of corralling that sentiment. So we feel like if you give people something they say, look, we have set up this opportunity for you to interact with us and complain or vent or kvetch, or whatever else you want to do, then at least you have some semblance of opportunity to keep your arms around it.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> And in that kind of circumstance is there room for some sort of guidelines for the discussion, some sort of policies for interaction or is it should just let them say anything or is there room for some structure?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Oh, heck, we believe very strongly in structure. (laughs) It’s not a matter of— I think sometimes we can go too far to the edge of saying, oh, don’t police it because then it’s over-contrived, but I think the problem is that’s not really a realistic approach for most companies to take and actually scale that because it’s not so much a matter of telling people what they can’t do as a matter of empowering them with what they can do, so everybody understands the rules of engagement. So we think guidelines and policies are actually really important, and we talk very much about those in shift 5 and what we think some of the key elements should be in those guidelines to help people understand the lay of the land because they’re an important tool for businesses who want to take this beyond just one or two people in their organization.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> The final section of the book deals with ROI online. Amber, what are some examples of the right and wrong things that people track?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> I had the chance to go into the right and wrong discussion because that one gets dicey. But I think the most important thing is to first understand what your aim is in the first place, so we talk about social media goals either aligning with awareness or sales or loyalty and making sure that the metrics you track line up to those types of goals. So if awareness is something that you’re after, metrics like reach or spread of information can actually be important indicators, but they may not be important indicators in terms of loyalty for your customers. So if you’re talking about customer loyalty you’ll want to track things like referrals or average transaction value over time and things like that. So, I think the important thing is understanding that we get caught up in a lot of these ideas, counting people like marbles or bottle caps or what have you because they’re easily accessible metrics and they’re very obvious ones to us.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Twitter followers.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Yeah, exactly.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> Yeah, exactly, that kind of thing. It’s so easy to get hung up on those things, but the really valuable information comes when you take those social media metrics and smash them together with other data points in your business that tell you something different.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So in other words tying these things to actual business goals.</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> You got it. And Jay is like the goal master in that sense, he’s really, really good at laying that out and he did a lot of the work on that chapter, so I should actually shut up and let him talk here.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Well, I mean the challenge is there are so many different potential success metrics in social media and they’re circumstantial by definition, right. What your goals and objectives are in social media will in fact dictate which success metrics make sense for you, but the trick is to understand what it is that you are measuring at the business level and then find appropriate success metrics within social that help model that desired behavior. What happens in reality far too much now is that companies create a social media program and then decide to start tracking it ex-post facto, so you end up with this statistical gerrymandering where they say, well, what can we get our hands on from a data standpoint, let’s try and make that fit into our sort of narrative of how this program is supposed to be going, which clearly leads to poor decision making.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I think in some ways it’s easier to make the case for The Now Revolution with large companies, but I believe that the small outfits, one to three people, represent such a great opportunity for growth and not just for book sales but growth in the space as a whole. And so how do you make the case for The Now Revolution to those people, the smaller entrepreneurs with small businesses that are short on time, Amber?</p><p><strong>Amber:</strong> I actually think that to your point they have a huge opportunity mostly because they don’t have to reverse engineer processes or people or structure points of the business that actually might be a hindrance to this kind of agility. So in that sense it’s definitely an advantage; for the small businesses they’re going to have to get comfortable with the idea of doing a little bit of multitasking and that they are the community manager and the person who does the analytics and the person who does the listening, and they’re just going to have to do as much as they can. I guess it’s important to start somewhere as opposed to trying to do all of it all at once, much like we learned to adapt to email or the Web and incorporate that into our workflow in our business, we’re just going to need to learn to adapt social media into that workflow as well. So I think small businesses have a huge opportunity to start doing that from the ground up without upending too much of what’s already existing in their business.</p><p><strong>Jay:</strong> Yeah, right. And so much of social media is about humanization and storytelling and building kinship, and small companies have a natural advantage in that regard because they’re so much closer to the customer, right, they understand the customer circumstance, the customer reality, much moreso than big companies do that have layers and layers of management. And so what we sometimes say is that social media lets big companies feel small again, but it gives small companies a natural advantage.</p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Excellent. Well Jay, Amber, that’s all I have.

For the next couple of weeks I am going to be discussing considerations for presenting your IA work to various audiences.</p><p>Here are four guidelines to keep in mind while you&#8217;re preparing to meet with or present IA directions to the developers involved in your next project:</p><h2>Be respectful.</h2><p>In every situation, always respect the developers. I’ve unfortunately been witness to and even participated in hasty critique of developers’ work. The truth is that we don’t know the constraints they were under when they created a system, what obstacles they had to overcome, and the problems that have already been solved. Make assumptions with benevolence, draw out current weak points as springboards for discussion, and use the project goals to guide constructive conversations.</p><h2>Be brief.</h2><p>Developers usually have several complicated problems rolling around in their heads that they’re in the middle of solving (occasionally this creates the illusion that they’re not listening, but don’t be fooled &#8211; they are). Acknowledge their cognitive load and don’t take up more time than is reasonable. They will respect you for your brevity and be glad to get back to working on those solutions.</p><h2>Get to the good stuff.</h2><p>These pragmatic problem solvers benefit from getting right to the meat of the matter, so make sure you cut verbal fluff where you can. Be careful here: that doesn’t mean they aren’t interested in the project goals, site audience, or other “soft” topics. In fact, it’s these details that give their work context and purpose. It’s the delivery which matters, which should be sans pretense and filler words.</p><h2>Engage with the details.</h2><p>From the very beginning of a project, the developers should and will be thinking through implementation details. Stay a step ahead by preparing thoughts and questions related to the implications for both front and back end development. Every piece of a wireframe or prototype impacts their scope. Sometimes this can get frustrating if you’re excitedly sharing a big idea and they’re giving you five reasons the execution of this idea is not going to fly. Expect this back and forth and be thankful that the development team is putting all that thought into the project.</p><p>Of course, I am painting with broad strokes here and every developer is unique (I work with ten and am married to one, so I have some firsthand experience). These guides are just a good place to start as you get to learn about and relate to these individuals on your project team.</p> <br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

These are pretty big changes, and from the comments I&#8217;ve seen so far, they introduce the potential for some issues, particularly for businesses who use Facebook Pages.</p><p>Since it appears this upgrade is happening, with or without the blessing of the people behind the estimated 3 million Pages on Facebook, we should learn as much as we can as quickly as we can about how to use the new design effectively.</p><p>I did some poking around in one of the most confusing features &#8212; using Facebook as if you are logged in as your Page, not you. Here is a look at what I&#8217;ve discovered.</p><h2>How to Login as Your Page</h2><p>There are two ways to switch between profile mode and Page mode. From your Page, you can click the link on the right that says &#8220;Use Facebook as [Your Page Name],&#8221; and then switch back by clicking &#8220;Use Facebook as [Your Name].&#8221;</p><p

The friend requests icon now displays new fans and the notifications icon displays new activity on your Page:</p><p

According to Facebook, it&#8217;s only possible for you to comment on profiles as your Page if a person allows everyone on Facebook to comment on their posts.</p><p>I also couldn&#8217;t use Facebook as my Page from my iPhone. According to Facebook, this functionality is not available for any mobile phones.</p><p>These changes will certainly take some getting used to. I&#8217;m finding it especially cumbersome to juggle the various login capabilities as the admin of multiple Pages. Between the Pages and a personal profile, it takes some extra diligence to ensure you&#8217;re posting to the right place as the right entity.</p><p>But all changes take time, and we&#8217;ll have to see how these impact Facebook users after the dust settles. I&#8217;m interested to hear your own feedback if you&#8217;ve explored the new changes. What do you love? Hate?</p> <br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>
