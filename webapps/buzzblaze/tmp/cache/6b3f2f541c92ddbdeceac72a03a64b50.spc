<p>How can public media spur multi-platform engagement through a national TV channel? That's the challenge that was posed to the team developing <a href="http://worldcompass.org/">WorldCompass.org</a>, the companion website for the World TV channel, a news and documentary channel now available in parts of 32 states. </p>

<p>The World channel, originally called <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PBS</span></span> World, was piloted in 2007 in the northeast <span class="caps"><span class="caps">U.S.</span></span> It featured <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PBS </span></span>programs -- mostly documentaries -- that were still in rights on a 24-hour channel. The channel went national in 2007. Two years later, Boston <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PBS </span></span>affiliate <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WGBH </span></span>instigated an effort to turn the channel into a multimedia project that invited new voices to public media. (To date, the World channel has not conducted national ratings, although a plan to obtain national numbers is in the works.)</p>

<p>Funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the World channel is the result of a collaborative partnership. The channel is produced and distributed by <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WGBH, WNET</span></span> New York and American Public Television in association with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PBS </span></span>and the National Educational Telecommunications Association, which is more commonly known as <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NETA.</span></span></p>

<p>The website has a slightly different makeup of partners. WorldCompass.org is managed by <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WGBH, </span></span>with American Public Television overseeing marketing and managing relationships with stations. The site has also pulled together a team of informal advisors from across the system to offer feedback on a multi-platform strategy. </p>

<h2>New Media Mission</h2>

<p>Part of World's mission is "to create a new model of content creation and delivery for public media 2.0, one that exemplifies diversity, digital media and dialogue." WorldCompass.org builds upon the broadcast offerings by offering its own curated content, blogs, and social media features.</p>

<p>Despite facing many of the common public broadcasting challenges -- most importantly, a small staff and a wanting budget -- WorldCompass.org has made clear strides since the beta launch and the staff is optimistic for the future. A revamped version of the site just launched in response to lessons learned through the initial beta site, which had been in operation since July 1, 2010. Expanded features include more integrated social media tools and organized menu items that help to reinforce the relationship between broadcast and online platforms.</p>

<p>The updated site hopes to take advantage of new tools to engage with "hip" 30- to 45-year-olds and capture the elusive 18- to 34-year-old demographic. </p>

<p>"Currently, a majority of our viewers are your usual <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PBS </span></span>demo of 50- to 60-year-olds," said Matey Odonkor, WorldCompass.org's manager of online communications. "Not that this is a bad thing."</p>

<p>Still, World TV has a different mission and audience in mind. "We want to offer age-relevant programming to young adults who grew up watching <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PBS </span></span>programs with their parents but stopped watching," said Odonokor.</p>

<h2>Cross-Platform Integration</h2>

<p>Like the World channel, WorldCompass.org aggregates content around monthly themes (<a href="http://worldcompass.org/content/skin">The Skin You're In</a>, <a href="http://worldcompass.org/content/diaspora">Diaspora</a>, etc.), including audio documentaries, feature length films, video blogs, television episodes, and other media. The monthly themes highlight connections among a wide range of stories -- both big and small, and objective and subjective. </p>

<p>This month's theme is <a href="http://worldcompass.org/content/land">Land</a>, and content includes a selection of audio (like this State of the Re:Union broadcast on <a href="http://worldcompass.org/content/greensburg-stars-through-difficulties">Greenburg, Kansas</a>) and video features (like this American Experience episode featuring the <a href="http://worldcompass.org/content/civilian-conservation-corps-american-experience">Civilian Conservation Corps</a>), plus a request for users' own stories about their experiences with land. There are currently no responses for this request, although it's still early in the month. However, February's request for users' own <a href="http://worldcompass.org/content/discuss-childhood">childhood stories</a> only garnered one user response during that month. </p>

<p>"The fun part," said managing editor Kavita Pillay, "has been connecting with emerging voices in public media -- people like <a href="http://snapjudgment.org/about-us">Glynn Washington</a>, <a href="http://www.harikondabolu.com/">Hari Kondabolu</a> and <a href="http://zadi.tv/">Zadi Diaz</a>."</p>

<p>Hari Kondabolu is an up-and-coming comic, who recently starred in a "Comedy Central Presents" <a href="http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/2011/02/08/comedy-central-presents-speed-dating-hari-kondabolu/">special</a>. His videoblogging for WorldCompass is more intimate and personal than his stand-up but no less funny. Here's a contribution he made to the Diaspora series:</p>

<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="500" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mtng_zRjSQY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h2>'Thematic Evolution'</h2>

<p>"The hope is to give the user/viewer an 'I never thought of it that way' moment as they go through a theme," Pillay said.</p>

<p>Currently, the topics are chosen by WorldCompass.org's staff and advisors. But, said Pillay, "at some point, we're considering a 'thematic evolution,' meaning that we'll retain the creative approach to themes but maybe present them in a different way or on a different calendar. And we'd love to start taking theme suggestions from users!"</p>

<p>Integration between the website and the channel has increased with the relaunch. Streamlined menu options include TV schedules and "Where to Watch" options. The site also now includes video previews and written summaries for films and programs airing on the World channel. WorldCompass.org producers are looking to increase this type of cross-platform promotion by highlighting broadcast content through more live chats, excerpts, deleted scenes and online exclusives.</p>

<p>On the broadcast side, the World channel runs regular interstitials sending viewers to the website for engagement activities and online extras.</p>

<p>And, added Odonkor, "The presence of World's crop of talented and funny videobloggers on TV and the website helps to tie the two platforms together."</p>

<h2>Increasing Engagement</h2>

<p>WorldCompass.org pairs content pieces with crowdsourcing activities. Such "Call-to-action items" include polls, quizzes, trivia, weekend assignments, and live votes. These often link users to WorldCompass's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/World-Compass/116149508430300">Facebook page</a> or a partner website. For example, this <a href="http://www.worldcompass.org/category/editorial-tags/faces-america">Faces of America video</a> includes a poll item about Henry Louis Gates' lineage. To find the correct answer, users are directed to an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=8195564"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ABC</span></span> News story</a>. </p>

<p>In addition to its <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/World-Compass/116149508430300">Facebook fan page</a>, which currently has 285 fans, WorldCompass has integrated social media with a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/world_compass">Twitter account</a> (96 followers), and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/WorldCompass">YouTube channel</a> (44 subscribers). While these numbers are small, the staff is experimenting with ways to increase them.</p>

<p>"When we can, we try to be creative with our use of social media -- for example, we organize Facebook live chats [with] viewers and producers," Odonkor said. "For what we do online, curating shorts, it's important we provide extras to engage users and invariably increase time spent on the site or the Facebook page."</p>

<p>WorldCompass.org also employs social media to promote partners' work. For example, the organization teamed up with the National Black Programming Consortium to promote Season 3 of the <a href="http://www.worldcompass.org/content/afropop-series">AfroPop Series</a> that is airing on World <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TV. </span></span></p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>So far WorldCompass.org's focus has been on introducing more appealing content -- and engaging users with it -- rather than convening citizens around particular issues or problems. The tone mirrors other productions and channels aimed at this smart, mobile, multi-ethnic demographic, such as Current TV or <span class="caps"><span class="caps">IFC.</span></span> It may be too early to tell how well this approach is working, or whether the site has succeeded in attracting viewers who don't already watch the channel. <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PBS </span></span>has long been attempting to court a younger, hipper demographic with less than stellar results.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for additional videobloggers joining the team over the next few months. In addition, WorldCompass.org is about to increase its original content in the near future, using a combination of licensing, commissioning, and crowdsourcing.</p>

<p>"The site and the channel are works in progress," said Pillay. "We know that there's a wonderful opportunity for us to find new ways to bring together content from users and emerging producers as well as from established folks." </p>

This practice is ubiquitous in online journalism, but its legal status has been <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2009/05/a-brief-history-of-aps-battles-with-news-aggregators146.html">in question</a> since the hyperlink was invented. </p>

<p>Righthaven, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LLC, </span></span>a for-profit intellectual property enforcement enterprise, has taken straight aim at the practice of online excerpting and linking through litigation. Founded last year by the publisher of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, <a href="http://www.stephensmedia.com/">Stevens Media</a>, and a group of copyright attorneys, the company has brought more than 230 copyright infringement lawsuits against website owners, bloggers, and even some individuals. All have been charged with posting unauthorized copies of copyrighted newspaper articles that have been assigned to Righthaven for the purposes of litigation.</p>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an online civil liberties group, has <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/09/righthavens-own-brand-copyright-trolling">denounced Righthaven</a> as one of the new "copyright trolls."</p>

<p>In response, Attorney Steven Gibson, Righthaven's founder, <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/01/06/righthaven-qa-cd-letters-dont-stop-infringement/">says the company</a> is merely "taking a fresh approach to help stem the tide of infringement on the Internet."</p>

<p>Regardless of who's right, these two opposing organizations are helping to define the legal use of digital content. The outcome of their legal battles may have important implications for legal rights and responsibilities of news organizations, bloggers, and commentors across Internet.</p>

<h2>Cashing in on content</h2>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/Righthaven-Lawsuits-250.jpg"><img alt="Righthaven-Lawsuits-250.jpg" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/assets_c/2011/03/Righthaven-Lawsuits-250-thumb-250x161-2967.jpg" width="250" height="161" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span>Righthaven has more than an approach; it has a business model. </p>

<p>The first 200 or so Righthaven lawsuits have been mostly brought in the District of Nevada, where the company is based, and typically allege that it owns copyright rights in an article published on the website of the Law Vegas Review-Journal. (Those rights were transferred to Righthaven by written agreement with Stephens Media.) The complaints assert that the named defendant or defendants are responsible for copyright infringement resulting from the posting of an unauthorized copy of the subject article, or a portion of the article, on the defendant's website or other online service.</p>

<p>What makes these suits especially difficult for site owners is that most of them concern articles that have been posted on a defendant's site by a third party, such as in a comment on the defendant's blog or online forum. The complaints do not make the distinction between copies posted by the owner of an online site and the user of an online site -- they only allege that an unauthorized copy of the article is posted on the defendant's site and that the defendant is responsible for the infringement. </p>

<p>In general, the operator of a website is exposed to liability for copyright infringement even where the copyrighted work is posted by a user of the site. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/copyright-claims-based-user-content">limits the liability</a> of site owners who take advantage of its provisions and remove copyrighted content upon receipt of a "takedown" notice. </p>

<p>But Righthaven's business model is to target websites that have not taken advantage of the so-called safe harbor provision in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DCMA.</span></span> Significantly, Righthaven does not request that the articles be removed prior to filing suit.</p>

<h2>Who pays</h2>

<p>The defendants in Righthaven lawsuits for the most part have been individual website owners and relatively small institutions -- often non-profits. The company has also been targeting the actual posters of copyrighted articles in some of its <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/jan/12/righthaven-extends-copyright-lawsuit-campaign-indi/">recent complaints</a>.</p>

<p>One prominent exception to this pattern is the lawsuit filed against the <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/dec/09/drudge-report-owner-sued-righthaven/">Drudge Report</a>, a leading conservative news aggregation website. On February 17, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/17/matt-drudge-settles-copyr_n_824798.html">Drudge settled</a> with Righthaven for an undisclosed sum.</p>

<p>Similarly, the group filed a lawsuit on February 24th <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/feb/25/righthaven-sues-las-vegas-based-citadel-broadcasti/">against Citadel Broadcasting Co.</a>, owner of a major radio network, over the posting of a copyrighted photograph on the website of one of its stations.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.righthavenlawsuits.com/">one of several</a> websites that track Righthaven lawsuits, the company follows the filing of a complaint with a demand for damages ranging from $75,000 to $150,000, and pressures for a quick settlement.</p>

<p>In addition to damages, Righthaven often seeks the transfer of the defendants' domain names. This is an unusual demand that <a href="http://blog.internetcases.com/2010/09/07/righthaven-seeks-domain-name-transfer-relief-that-is-not-called-for-under-the-copyright-act/">critics have charged</a> is questionable under the law and designed to intimidate unsophisticated defendants and add to the pressure to quickly settle.</p>

<h2>Early Success</h2>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/copyright%20all%20rights.jpg"><img alt="copyright all rights.jpg" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/assets_c/2011/03/copyright all rights-thumb-250x157-2969.jpg" width="250" height="157" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a></span>Numerous defendants appear to have succumbed to Righthaven's settlement demands, for amounts that may be as small as the mid- to low-four figures. Because the terms of settlements typically are confidential, the amounts actually paid in the settlements are in most cases not a matter of record.</p>

<p>On the day the Drudge case ended, the Righthaven Lawsuits website (not affiliated with the copyright company) <a href="http://www.righthavenlawsuits.com/lawsuits.html">noted</a> that 104 Righthaven cases had closed, presumably by settlement. The site estimated that Righthaven has earned in excess of $365,000 in revenue, based upon an estimated $3,500 per case.</p>

<p>Some defendants have failed to respond to Righthaven complaints, which has allowed the company to begin filing motions -- first, for the entry of a default, then for the entry of a default judgment. A default judgment is an enforceable court order for the payment of the amount of damages awarded by the court. These cases have the potential to yield a greater return for Righthaven than those that have settled thus far, and may include other legal relief that Righthaven has requested, such as the turnover of the defendant's domain name. </p>

<p>On February 10, Righthaven made its <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/feb/12/righthaven-files-first-judgment-motion-demands-cas/">first motion for a default judgment</a>. It demanded $150,000 in damages for infringement -- the maximum amount of statutory damages allowed under <span class="caps"><span class="caps">U.S. </span></span>law for willful infringement of a single work -- $1,500 in attorney fees, and $350 in costs. In addition to financial damages, it also requested a permanent injunction and an order turning over the defendant's domain name to Righthaven. </p>

<p>The court has yet to rule on Righthaven's request, but it is unlikely that anything near the maximum of statutory damages will be awarded. Judges have considerable discretion is awarding statutory damages, ranging from the minimum amount of  $750 per work to the maximum requested by Righthaven. But where the defendant can show that it was not aware of the infringement, that figure can be reduced to as little as $200. </p>

<h2>Standing up for their Rights</h2>

<p>Not all of the Righthaven defendants are settling or failing to answer. Some have raised a variety of defenses, including the copyright "fair use" doctrine, with some success.<br />
 <br /><br />
In <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/39767798/Righthaven-v-Realty-One-Order">Righthaven v. Realty One Group</a>, a blogger who posted an eight-sentence excerpt from a Las Vegas Review-Journal article, including a link, obtained a dismissal on the grounds of fair use. The court ruled that the use of the excerpt was fair as a matter of law -- that is, without the need for further fact-finding.</p>

<p>The ruling noted among other things that the blogger copied only the factual portion of the article, not the reporter's commentary, and thus the blogger's use "does not satisfy a reader's desire to view and read [the entire article including] the author's original commentary and thereby does not dilute the market for the copyrighted work."</p>

<p>The court also noted that the blogger had included a link to the source of the article containing the full text. </p>

<p>The Righthaven v. Realty One Group decision is a significant ruling in that it may influence Nevada District judges assigned to other cases in which Righthaven is alleging that only a portion of an article was posted. But many of the lawsuits involve the posting of entire articles. Fair use is a lot more difficult argument to make when an entire work has been appropriated.</p>

<h2>From Fair Use to Implied License</h2>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/200px-Question_copyright.svg.png"><img alt="200px-Question_copyright.svg.png" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/assets_c/2011/03/200px-Question_copyright.svg-thumb-200x286-2971.png" width="200" height="286" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span>Nevertheless, in <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/nevada/nvdce/2:2010cv00741/73473/14/0.pdf">Righthaven v. Klerks</a> -- a case involving the posting of an entire article -- the operator of an online forum successfully used the fair use defense in moving to reopen the case after a default had been entered for failure to answer. Klerks asserted that he had not been properly served in the case.</p>

<p>The court ruled that as a preliminary matter, Klerks had shown that fair use was a "sufficiently meritorious" defense to justify reopening the case, even though the fact that the entire article was used was a factor weighing against a fair use finding.</p>

<p>Klerks also raised what the court called a potentially more meritorious defense: Implied license. A license to use a copyrighted work may be implied where the conduct of the copyright holder is such that the party using the work may justifiably infer that there is consent to the use.</p>

<p>The court in Klerks v. Righthaven pointed to the fact that the newspaper publisher "encouraged people to save and share the article with others without restrictions, and permitted users to 'right-click' and copy the article from its website." The ruling added, there was a "plausible argument" for an implied license, "especially in light of the established and accepted custom of users freely and openly sharing certain information posted on the Internet." </p>

<p>That is a broad statement indeed, and one that should concern content owners whose intent in making their work available online is selective sharing, not permission for wholesale and unrestricted copying.</p>

<p>As with the issue of fair use, the final resolution of the implied license issue must await further proceedings in the case.</p>

<h2><span class="caps"><span class="caps">EFF </span></span>to the Defense</h2>

<p>In the fall of last year, the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EFF </span></span>moved on from denouncing Righthaven as a copyright troll to <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/08/eff-seeks-righthaven-defendants">inviting Righthaven defendants</a> to seek the organization's legal assistance. The copyright troll accusation has resurfaced in the arguments that the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EFF </span></span>has made in two of the several cases in which it has become involved: Righthaven v. Democratic Underground and Righthaven v. Center for Intercultural Organizing (CIO). </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.eff.org/files/filenode/righthaven_v_dem/AnswerandCounterclaim.pdf">one of its filings</a> in Righthaven v. Democratic Underground, the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EFF </span></span>described Righthaven's complaint as the action as "a particularly abusive instance of a broad and aggressive strategy" by a "sham" plaintiff.</p>

<p>Righthaven has responded in kind. In a <a href="http://www.eff.org/files/filenode/righthaven_v_dem/57-RH-ResposeMSJ.pdf">filing</a> in that same case, it referred to the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EFF </span></span>as "vexatious" and "vituperative." In an affidavit filed in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CIO </span></span>dispute, Righthaven accusing the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EFF </span></span>of having "aggressively litigated" the cases in which it is involved by "driving up litigation costs through extensive motion practice and discovery efforts." </p>

<p>Will the judges find these respective accusations relevant to the underlying issues in the litigation? Or view them as mere attempts at adversarial well-poisoning? That much remains to be seen.</p>

<p>But it is clear that the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EFF </span></span>intends to disrupt Righthaven's business model. Any litigation in which the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EFF </span></span>becomes involved is likely to be hard-fought on both sides.</p>

<h2>Righthaven Takes Its Show on the Road</h2>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/righthaven.jpg"><img alt="righthaven.jpg" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/assets_c/2011/03/righthaven-thumb-300x70-2973.jpg" width="300" height="70" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span>The fair use rulings in the District of Nevada may have slowed Righthaven down a bit. It appears that the company may have temporarily suspended filing additional lawsuits in that district.</p>

<p>However, Righthaven has now partnered with <a href="http://www.medianewsgroup.com/Pages/default.aspx">MediaNews</a>, the publisher of the Denver Post. In December, Righthaven filed a single complaint with respect to content from that newspaper in the District of South Carolina, and on January 20, it started filing a series of complaints in the District of Colorado.</p>

<p>Notably, the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/18/dean-singleton-steps-down_n_810714.html">outgoing <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CEO</span></span></a> of MediaNews, Dean Singleton, is also the chairman of the Associated Press. The AP has previously <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2009/05/a-brief-history-of-aps-battles-with-news-aggregators146.html">taken a strong position against</a> excerpting news stories.</p>

<p>From a procedural perspective, filing new lawsuits in other federal districts is a smart move. Judges in the other federal districts are not obliged to follow the District of Nevada rulings that are adverse to Righthaven, nor would they be required to follow any adverse ruling on appeal from the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">U.S.</span></span> Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. (Colorado is in the Tenth Circuit; South Carolina is in the Fourth Circuit.) </p>

<h2>More revenue, more responsibility</h2>

<p>Even if Righthaven is reasonably successful overall in its litigation campaign on behalf of its present and future newspaper clients, as a practical matter it is unlikely to put a dent in the practice of re-posting online news content and linking to its source.</p>

<p>What it may achieve is a de facto licensing scheme that will restore some small amount of the revenue loss suffered by its client newspapers due to declining subscription and advertising sales. How large or small that revenue stream will be depends upon how the courts view the fair use, implied license, and other issues raised in the case. In any event, sorting out those issues in the Righthaven cases may provide needed guidance on the use of online news content.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the immediate lesson for website operators, blog owners, and other service providers that allow users to submit content to their sites is that they should take advantage of the protection of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DMCA </span></span>safe harbor provisions. Like flu shots, seat belts, and bicycle helmets, the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DMCA </span></span>can provide low-cost protection from damages for infringement caused by third parties.</p>

<p>For content owners, there may also be important lessons in how the judges in the Righthaven lawsuits address the issue of implied license. At a minimum, content owners should review any license terms in their website terms of use. Making clear what uses are expressly licensed may forestall arguments that there is a much broader, implied license to distribute their content.</p>

Major publishers now sprinkle their sites with Facebook plug-ins, from fan page widgets to friend recommendations to the ubiquitous "Like" thumbs-up. And hey, why not? It's a win-win, with publishers getting more engagement and increased traffic from Facebook News Feeds, and Facebook getting more embedded in more of the web.</p>

<p>So it is not a bit surprising that along comes <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/472">a Facebook Comments plug-in upgrade</a>, offering added moderation for comments on publishers' sites with these very nifty features:</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>Simple upgrade</strong>: Publishers only need to add one line of code to their site for the new comments box.</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>Enhanced moderation</strong>: Publishers get control to make specific comments private (only seen by the commenter and their friends); or publishers can delete comments and blacklist users.</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>Commenting in the News Feed</strong>: Users can now share the comments they've made on publishers' sites in their Facebook News Feed; their friends' comments on the News Feed update are automatically posted back to the publishers' sites.</p>

<p>The last feature is perhaps the most important viral/social element of the Comments system -- the chance to get comments to reach beyond a website and into the Facebook social stream and bounce back to the website itself. That kind of easy sharing was missing from comments previously.</p>

<p>So, for instance, when I posted a comment on the Facebook blog, I made sure to share it with my News Feed on Facebook, as you can see here:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="comment on news feed.jpg" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/comment%20on%20news%20feed.jpg" width="520" height="335" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span></p>

<p>And then, when Jen Lee Reeves and I commented on that comment on my News Feed, our comments were posted both on the News Feed, as seen above, and on the original Facebook blog post, as seen here:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="comment on facebook blog.jpg" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/comment%20on%20facebook%20blog.jpg" width="520" height="285" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span></p>

<p>Plus, there's the much vaunted advantage of making people comment with their real names and affiliations showing, cutting down on trolls and ne'erdowells. (At least, that's the hope -- until they figure out a way to create fake Facebook accounts and return with their invective flowing.)</p>

<p>The new Comments upgrade was announced yesterday, with publishers such as Sporting News, Examiner.com and Discovery jumping on board (and TechCrunch is trying a test as well). According to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-TechCrunchs-decision-to-use-Facebook-comments-in-part-a-reaction-to-Quora-product-s-use-of-real-identities">a discussion summary at Quora</a>, the pros of Facebook Comments on TechCrunch so far are real identities, while the cons are loss of anonymous comments by people who are uncomfortable saying who they are. And more troubling is that you can't log in to Facebook Comments with Twitter or Google.</p>

<p>I spoke to Facebook media guy <a href="http://www.facebook.com/josofsky">Justin Osofsky</a> yesterday to do a quick interview about the release of the upgraded Comments. Below is the full audio interview, and the edited transcript of that call, including one interjection by Facebook spokesperson Jillian Carroll.</p>

<h2><span class="caps"><span class="caps">Q&amp;A</span></span></h2>

<p><strong>What was your overarching goal with the update of Comments?</strong></p>

<p>Justin Osofsky: We're always working to iterate on our products, and this update is a natural evolution of our existing plug-in, which we first launched in February 2009. Over the past couple years, we worked really closely with partners, and listen to their feedback all the time. One of the consistent themes we heard related to Comments was that partners wanted a system with great moderation, which led to a quality discussion on their site and provided great distribution. That was the spirit behind the product we released today as an upgrade.</p>

<p>My team works with media partners, and listens to their feedback and helps them understand how to use Facebook's tools to derive value for their business. In regards to Comments, we heard two themes from [publishers] outside of moderation. One is they use Facebook as a distribution platform. Comments offer a great opportunity to get distribution. Users can easily share their comments back to Facebook; the average user on Facebook has 130 friends, so they can extend the conversation around the web. </p>

<p>The other theme we heard from partners is that they really wanted a quality conversation around their content. They cared more about quality than quantity. And as the number of blogs and content sites we visit every day grows, it should be easy to see the highest quality comments first -- based on feedback from your friends and the rankings from other readers. </p>

<p><strong>Many people have said, including <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2011/03/01/i-really-like-techcrunchs-new-facebook-comments/">social media power user Robert Scoble</a>, that they like the new Comments feature because it will lead to more civilized discourse because people have their names associated with comments. But I've seen the opposite on well trafficked Facebook pages because people can punch in their comments so easily without having to register first. Sometimes they will throw things out quicker than they should.</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: We think we can facilitate a higher quality conversation. The Comments plug-in makes commenting online more like having a conversation in the real world by leveraging authentic and persistent identities to create more quality and meaningful dialogue across the web. We think that will lead to a higher quality conversation when it's your real identity and you're representing your real self in the comments you're making.</p>

<p><strong>How have you seen publishers adopting the new Comments plug-in? Are they using just Facebook Comments on stories, or using other types of commenting systems as well?</strong></p>

<img alt="Justin Osofsky.JPG" img class=caption src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/Justin%20Osofsky.JPG" title="Justin Osofsky" /></form>

<p>Osofsky: We're seeing a lot of publishers who adopted Facebook's commenting system as the exclusive commenting system on their site. Sites like SportingNews.com and Discovery Communication and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">SBN</span></span>ation launched with Facebook Comments today. </p>

<p><strong>You allow either Facebook or Yahoo log-ins now to comment on these sites. Where are you at with allowing people to use Google or Twitter log-ins?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: As part of the update, we added Yahoo as a third-party log-in and we hope to add additional major providers in the future. We're always looking for ways to improve the product and add more flexibility for partners, but we have nothing further to announce today.</p>

<p><strong>Who do you see as the main competition for your Comments plug-in? Do you think there's a way for you to co-exist with established players like Disqus (used on MediaShift), Echo, and others?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: When we develop products, we focus on meeting the needs of our users and developers in creating really good solutions. Basically, this release is based on feedback from users and developers and partners. We plan on continuing to iterate on it, but we think that the greater moderation that's built into this product, the distribution of reaching Facebook's more than 500 million users, the higher engagement through the conversations -- threading on both the publisher's site and on Facebook itself -- and the quality makes us a really compelling product for publishers.</p>

<p><strong>One of the features that's interesting is that when you see someone's comment, a friend of yours, on your News Feed on Facebook, you can respond to it, with the comment going back on the third party site. Do you think that might take people a little while to get used to?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: I think users will understand the natural conversation. What's cool about this product is the most interesting content on Facebook is the stuff I discover through my friends. Over 30 billion pieces of content are shared on Facebook each month. It's a way to find content through friends and other people. </p>

<p>What the commenting system enables now is -- when I am commenting on an article on, say, MediaShift -- I immediately have social context and the opinion of my friend that is being delivered on whatever the article is on your site. From that, I think there's a very natural discussion that takes place that's unified on both sites. So users will see that lead to a richer, authentic dialogue on publishers' sites and on Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>One thing I'd like to see is all the conversations happening about an article all over the web in one place. And Facebook has FriendFeed, which does that a little bit. Can you see sometime down the road that this might be a unified comment system that brings together comments from other sites too? So you'd see them all in your Facebook News Feed?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: We see the News Feed as a way of discovering content from your friends. So if I comment on an article on the Sporting News and Discover and the Examiner, my friends can now see it on their News Feed. So it's a great way to discover the conversations that are happening among the friends you are most interested in.</p>

<p><strong>But as far as being an aggregator of comments from other systems, you don't see that happening at some point?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: No. The News Feed will always be a good way to make social discovery of content, but that's the way we view it. You go to Facebook to find out what your friends like. When you show up to Facebook.com and I show up to Facebook.com -- even though we typed in an identical <span class="caps"><span class="caps">URL </span></span>-- we're having fundamentally different experiences because we have different friends and different interests, and they are sharing different things about their lives and from publisher sites. That's the experience that will continue on Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>When I look in my Facebook News Feed I can see when people connect their tweets to their status updates. So I am seeing things from other services outside of Facebook. That's why I'm wondering whether other comments could be brought into the News Feed like that.</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: When we launched the platform in 2007, we basically opened it up for developers to allow people to connect with the things they care most about, and the entities they care most about -- whether it's a sports team, whether it's a celebrity. And because of that, I think that Facebook is a great way to find things in your life, and that's the way that Facebook works, and that's the way it's going to continue to work going forward.</p>

<p><strong>When you talk about comment moderation, you said comments from friends and top-rated comments would rise to the top. Some comment systems have a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down." Will you continue to have just the thumbs up or would you consider a thumbs down as well?</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="HateButton small.gif" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/HateButton%20small.gif" width="150" height="65" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></span></p>

<p>Osofsky: We will listen to feedback on how to best surface the best and most relevant comments. We have no immediate plans to change what we launched today. But essentially we want users to see a really quality conversation, and we think the way you do it is you first see the comments from your friends and then the comments ranked highly from other readers on a publisher's site.</p>

<p><strong>There is a way to block comments that you don't like, or report them?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: As you're reading, you can mark comments as spam or report them as being abusive. </p>

<p><strong>And it's up to the publisher to decide what to do with those reports?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: We will naturally surface the most highly ranked comments, those will be the ones you'll see more than other comments. And we also give moderation controls to publishers. Based on their feedback, we added a lot of moderation controls as well as "blacklist" controls so website administrators can control the visibility of a comment from making it private [i.e., only shown to the commenter and their friends] to hiding it completely. Or they they can block content or specific words -- such as foul language and spam -- all from their own moderation dashboard.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="comment moderation copy.jpg" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/comment%20moderation%20copy.jpg" width="520" height="190" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span></p>

<p><strong>Will a reader see a highly rated comment above their friends' comments or which one comes first? And can the publisher adjust that?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: Each individual reader that goes to a publisher's site, on the site, they would see a different view. Just like you or I have different friends, from that, what you see in a comments box and I see would be different. The publisher has an administrative dashboard that also shows the comments that are being made on their site.</p>

<p><strong>So which would be ranked higher, the friends' comments or the ones ranked high by readers?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: The product seeks to surface the highest quality comments first, and the way in which we built it, we'll continue to evolve our approach to this to make sure there's really quality conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Part of what you see with the comments is the person's affiliation or where they went to college. Is there a way to adjust what shows there alongside a person's name next to a comment?</strong></p>

<p>Jillian Carroll (Facebook Communications): It's an interesting situation. If you made your school network public but not your work, then your school would show up even if it's more relevant where you work. Part of this will be addressed by privacy controls and people adjusting those.</p>

<p>Osofsky: When we release products, we respect people's privacy settings. And if they want to change their privacy settings, we give them the control to do that.</p>

<p><strong>One other piece of feedback I heard was that TechCrunch had implemented Facebook Comments and they're not seeing a number on the number of comments for each article, that there are "48 comments" or whatever. Is that something you will be adding?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: We believe our product encourages quality instead of quantity of comments. What I think you're seeing today on publisher sites is a very real and interesting dialogue in the comments section. One of the consistent things we heard from publishers, who we've been talking to the past couple years, is you often get so many comments, one can't surface the relevant and interesting comments. That's what this product is trying to address.</p>

<img alt="digitaljournal screengrab.jpg" img class=caption src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/digitaljournal%20screengrab.jpg" title="DigitalJournal.com has a hybrid commenting system with Facebook Comments and their own system" /></form>

<p><strong>What about people who aren't on Facebook? Would they still be able to comment on a story?</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: You can log in on Facebook or you can log in on Yahoo, and we'll be looking to add additional flexibility going forward in terms of log-in providers.</p>

<p><strong>So at the moment if you don't have Yahoo and you don't have Facebook, then you're not able to make comments in the system.</strong></p>

<p>Osofsky: The two ways to comment in the system is through Yahoo and Facebook, correct.</p>

<p>He has taken over 1,000 portraits of prominent people across a variety of fields for articles on Wikipedia.org and its foreign language equivalents. Because the pictures are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> -- or free for reproduction, alteration, and distribution -- they are used by numerous non-profits, schools, authors, television programs and well known publications, such as the New York Times and the Miami Herald. </p>

<p>He has also interviewed leaders ranging from Al Sharpton to Israeli President Shimon Peres and given presentations in the United States and abroad about Wikipedia, new media and Internet culture. </p>

<p>But, as a recent <a href="http://www.cjr.org/on_the_job/the_wikinews_ace.php">Columbia Journalism Review</a> article about this famous Wikipedian revealed, Shankbone isn't even his real name and journalism isn't his profession. It's David Miller and his day job is doing legal work on Wall Street.    </p>

<p>In spite of all that, Shankbone has had a big influence on the development of web culture. In a discussion conducted via email, I asked Shankbone about his controversial contributions to Wikipedia, the way the web and WikiLeaks are changing journalism, and what he thinks legacy media organizations need to do to survive in the digital age.</p>

<p><b>Your portraits of famous people range from Taylor Swift to Gore Vidal, and they have been used by news sites ranging from Vanity Fair to Forbes. Do you identify yourself as a photojournalist, artist, or what?</b></p>

<p>Shankbone: Probably more of an artist. Information is realist art and I create information. The challenge to be empirical was more exciting for me than infusing my work with my own perspective.</p>

<p><b>A few years ago your photo documenting the making of an adult film was <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/freedom-to-leak-20100731-110fw.html">banned by the Australian government</a>. Do you think the Internet pushes society's limits of what is acceptable, or does it reflect what is already there?</b></p>

<p>Shankbone: Knowledge pushes those boundaries. Few aspects of society are hidden any more and Wikipedia's approach to unadulterated information plays a hand. </p>

<p>Explicit images on Wikipedia have been very controversial, but time is on the side of the editors who want little censorship of reality. There's a rational line to be drawn, but what kind of porn researcher would be surprised and offended to see an example of how it's made on the pornography article [in Wikipedia]?</p>

<p><b>Another one of your photos, "Palestinian Boy with Toy Gun in Nazareth" (below, left) you placed on the Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_and_minors_in_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict">Children and Minors in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</a>. This caused controversy because some critics believed you were trying to push a political view, since you had taken it on a press junket that was funded by the Israeli government. What prompted you to choose that photo?</b></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/250-Palestinian_boy_with_toy_guy_in_Nazareth_by_David_Shankbone.jpg"><img alt="250-Palestinian_boy_with_toy_guy_in_Nazareth_by_David_Shankbone.jpg" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/assets_c/2011/03/250-Palestinian_boy_with_toy_guy_in_Nazareth_by_David_Shankbone-thumb-250x178-2945.jpg" width="250" height="178" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span>Shankbone: I saw the photograph and thought about the debate over whether children playing with toy weapons increases violence. A few years earlier in Israel, a child with a toy gun was shot by a soldier -- something that also happens in the United States with the police. There was also a study in Israel about the psychological effects the conflict had on children. So, given all of that, I thought the photograph of a child in Israel with a toy gun worked.</p>

<p>It was only a few people who took the worst possible interpretation, which is that I was portraying this child as a terrorist. At the same time I placed Palestinian Kids in Nazareth, a photo of his friends hugging, on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Friendship&amp;oldid=240422361">Friendship article</a>, and that photo is now found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palestinian_people&amp;oldid=416146781">Palestinian people</a> article.</p>

<p><b>How do you feel about the role digital media is playing in the Middle East protests?</b></p>

<p>Shankbone: Satellite and Internet make it impossible to control what people know. I am as nervous as anyone about how it will all look a year from now, but the desire of a nation to be freer and find its own voice is something to be cheered, even when it's not clear that it's in America's best interest.</p>

<p><b>What impact have the Internet and bloggers had on journalism?</b></p>

<p>Shankbone: Corporatism hurt American journalism and the Internet exposed that it was no longer functioning as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate">Fourth Estate</a>. New York Times executive editor Bill Keller admitted that the government vetted the Wikileaks cables before [his paper] published them. What a far cry from the Pentagon Papers. It's a problem. We need the media. But everyone across the political spectrum is angry because too often journalists fail at what they purport to do.</p>

<p><b>WikiLeaks is a polarizing force in American media. Is the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2262066/">radical transparency</a> espoused by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange changing traditional journalism mores?</b></p>

<p>Shankbone: WikiLeaks means the public will expose lies, horror, and hypocrisy if the media won't. The best analysis is on blogs and the best journalism is public or foreign. American reporters crave 'access' -- and their editors demand it, no matter how much it corrupts.</p>

<img alt="250px-Tom_Brokaw_by_David_Shankbone.jpg" img class=caption src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/assets_c/2011/03/250px-Tom_Brokaw_by_David_Shankbone-thumb-250x374-2951.jpg" title="Tom Brokaw" /></a></form>

<p>I recently had a drink with a writer from Gawker and I said, 'You guys must be invited to so many incredible parties.' He replied, 'Believe it or not, we aren't because people are worried that we will write something unflattering.' A real journalist should be able to say the same. Instead, I photograph them on red carpets.</p>

<p>Sadly for the foreseeable future, hacks will reign at the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times will be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/business/media/06tribune.html">a degraded mess</a>, the New York Times will fumble along, and cable news will be little better than talk radio. </p>

<p><b>What changes would you like to see legacy media organizations make in the digital age?</b></p>

<p>Shankbone: They think to be neutral is to be uncontroversial and to not assert the truth. They think balance means two opposing views and that somewhere in the middle is moderation. Such ridiculous notions have come to define the attempt to present reality to their audiences. The jig is up: Everybody knows that it's impossible to be totally neutral.</p>

<p>Don't shout from the rooftops that you have a perspective, just stop insisting that you don't and try your damnedest not to let it bias your facts. Mimic the example of the profitable Economist magazine, the most respected publication in the world. Fox News would be great if it was a place where the interesting nuance of conservative thought was hashed out before its viewers.</p>

<p>Be daring. Try new things. Newspapers should involve local citizen reporters in their articles, with talent the only barrier to consideration. Discover the good local bloggers and photographers and develop relationships with them. Dispatch them. Pay them a nominal fee. Have regular reporters work with locals and give them one of those "additional reporting by..." credits. That would help foster a cohesive bond with the communities that they serve.</p>

In this video report, Jaron considers the effects of social media on the Egyptian revolution.</em></p>

<p>I wondered how Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak eventually knew about the hundreds of thousands of people in the streets calling for his resignation. Surely, he had many agents on the streets providing him information, but how did he ever see the pictures? Egyptian State television was showing children's programming and soap operas while molotov cocktails were being hurled at government buildings outside its studios. Perhaps, just once, he took a quick sneak-peak at the stations run by those "saboteurs" at Al Jazeera or <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CNN</span></span>? Did he, at the ripe old age of 82, ever log on to YouTube or Bamboozer to see one of the thousands of videos posted from Tahrir Square?</p>

<p>If he did, then Mr. Mubarak must have been shocked to see the gluttonous orgy of media being produced from his country. While Egypt lay dormant for 30 years, the media had metamorphosized from a larvae to a butterfly. It was no longer a one-dimensional, black-and-white tool to brainwash the populace, but a colorful cornucopia of apps, gadgets, and platforms, resulting in infinite bits of information. Simply by virtue of connecting to the outside world, Egypt's media landscape transformed along with it, seemingly overnight. Suddenly, the tables had turned. The more Mubarak tried to tighten the noose, the more bloggers he created.</p>

<p>For all the other despots out there who still think the media begins and ends with Channel 1, your Revolution will soon be shown on an iPhone near you. Qaddhafi is now finding this out in Libya. After his awkward appearance on Libyan state TV showing that he is still in Tripoli, there are now much higher quality productions being made on YouTube depicting his losing battle. For Mubarak and his ilk, it has become awfully difficult to completely suppress media. Even the most repressive regime in the world, North Korea, now allows limited cell phone use, but still blocks all Internet access. While the North Korea model may be the only way for these tyrants to hold onto power, I'm afraid it may be too late for most regimes who have already given their people a taste of cyber-freedom. The cat's already out of the bag. People who have searched on Google and have poked on Facebook aren't going to be satisfied with state TV any longer.</p>

<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="520" height="323" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zwwrXCimz9s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>If you can't commit to a movie marathon this weekend, the Academy, as well as media and technology companies, have created digital popcorn for snacking on the Oscar experience before Sunday.</p>

<p><b>The Academy</b></p>

<p>The Oscars and nominated movies are omnipresent in digital media and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is showing true grit with its promotional campaign.  <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ABC, </span></span>the official broadcast partner for the Oscars through 2020, created the Oscar Backstage Pass, a companion app for the telecast that offers live camera views from the red carpet, the Kodak Theatre and the Governor's Ball.  Available for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, the $0.99 app (iTunes <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oscar-backstage-pass/id411784735?mt=8&amp;ls=1">link</a>) gives viewers directorial powers previously limited to a select few.  Out of the nine camera angles offered in the Kodak Theatre, including Host Cam, Thank You Cam and Audience Cam, the most intriguing may be Control Booth Cam.  When a winner's speech exceeds the time limit, this viewpoint could possibly give us the Cue Music Cam.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/Oscar%20Backstage%20Pass.jpg"><img alt="Oscar Backstage Pass.jpg" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/assets_c/2011/02/Oscar Backstage Pass-thumb-367x480-2939.jpg" width="367" height="480" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></span></p>

<p>For those who prefer the free experience, download "The Oscars" mobile app for access to the latest news and events or try to predict the winners in all 24 categories.  Currently, 23 percent of The Oscars app users think "The King's Speech" will win Best Picture, while "The Social Network" is second with 18 percent.  The only runaway favorite is Natalie Portman, with 71 percent believing that she'll dance away with Best Actress.  </p>

<img alt="Oscars red-carpet-experience.jpg" img class=caption src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/Oscars%20red-carpet-experience.jpg" title="The Oscar Experience kiosk" /></form>

<p>Walk down Broadway about 20 blocks from the New York City Ballet and you'll find yourself next to an interactive display called The Oscar Experience.  Fans can have their picture taken next to a virtual Oscar statuette. Some hold the statue, while others prefer to smile or cry as if they are giving an acceptance speech.  The photo galleries may be viewed on the Academy's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheAcademy">Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p><b>Google</b></p>

<p>Google is tracking the global search trends for the Oscar nominees in an easy-to-use tool appropriately called <a href="http://oscartrends.appspot.com">Oscar Search Trends</a>.  The charts for all categories may be customized for the last 30 days, the last 12 months or all years.  Obscure international search results include the following: "Inception" leads all searches among Visual Effects nominees with Singapore driving the volume above India, while "Inside Job" leads Documentary Feature nominees with Portugal edging out Canada in volume.  "Black Swan" leads all Best Picture nominees in global search popularity.  And if you know Google, they prefer "Black Swan" searches over black hat search engine optimization.</p>

<p><b>Twitter</b></p>

<p>The cinematic characters and the actors who potray them will surely be a focal point of the  tweets that Oscar watchers will post on Sunday.  Follow the #Oscars hashtag on Twitter to see a continuous stream of comments on all things Oscar -- the winners, the fashion, the jokes, the speeches, the surprises, the parties and the totally inappropriate or irrelevant. For a more intimate and insightful Oscar experience, follow the tweets of these Oscar nominees:</p>

<p>You may want to believe that "The Kids Are All Right," but in kid reenactments of the Best Picture nominees, the kids are all ridiculous. Yes, ridiculously cute and cut-throat, as in "The Social Network" clip (below), or cute and cut-arm in "127 Hours."</p>

<p><b>GetGlue</b></p>

<p>While you're watching Sunday's telecast on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ABC </span></span>and seeing the accuracy of your picks dwindle with each category, find comfort in something that truly sticks -- such as an official Oscars sticker from GetGlue, a social network that enables entertainment check-ins. It may not be "The Social Network," but it's one of many digitally choreographed programs attempting to get movie fans glued to the Oscars.  </p>

<p>It's difficult to deny that social media platforms are changing the face of modern communication. Online tools are a growing part of how news is sourced, published, and consumed. The revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt demonstrated the importance of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2011/02/nprs-andy-carvin-on-tracking-and-tweeting-revolutions.html">social media literacy for journalists</a>. </p>

<p>Yet integrating social media into university classrooms can be a daunting task for many journalism educators. Professors are typically required to use clunky online systems for grading and communicating with students. It's an unpleasant experience for everyone involved. These awkward systems don't inspire creativity, enrich collaboration, or instill a passion for experimentation -- all of which are required to survive and succeed in a rapidly changing media industry.</p>

<p>This post will examine a few innovative uses of social media that journalism professors are trying out in the classroom. Not every tool is appropriate for every class, but there are undoubtedly ways in which most instructors can find room for at least some of these ideas. </p>

<h2>Facebook</h2>

<p>Yes, Facebook can play a significant, positive role in the classroom. And no, professors don't have to become "friends" with their students to make use of it. </p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/">Facebook Groups</a></b> provide a place where students can post ideas, links, and even photos or videos. When one uploads content to a Facebook group, neither the action nor the information shows up on a person's wall. It remains completely within the walls of the group. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Facebook Group Interaction" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/facebook-students.jpg" width="300" height="189" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></span></p>

<p>The main reason to use a Facebook group is that students are already there. They don't have to remember another log-in or remember to go visit "the class forum." It fits seamlessly into their lives. It takes very little effort to click "like" or add a comment to a classmate's idea. This fact alone encourages more interaction than other platforms. </p>

<p>Groups come in three varieties: open, closed or secret. "Open" groups are public, "closed" groups keep content private but allow others to see its list of members, and "secret" won't show up anywhere.</p>

<p>I recommend "closed" groups for classes. This gives students a private space to speak and makes it easy for others to join. Simply send a link to a closed group and others can request to join. (For more on Facebook Groups, read <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2010/10/public-closed-or-secret-how-to-use-the-new-facebook-groups288.html">this excellent post</a> by Jen Lee Reeves, who teaches at the University of Missouri.)</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php">Facebook Pages</a></b> are used by news organizations to share stories and even <a href="http://modernjournalist.com/2011/01/24/facebook-npr-sourcing-tool/">to find sources for stories</a>. Journalism instructor Staci Baird has her students manage <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/San-Francisco-Beat/131791390198677">San Francisco Beat</a> as part of the Digital News Gathering class at San Francisco State University.</p>

<p>"I want my students to get used to trying new things, thinking outside the box," she said. Other benefits Baird cited included "real-world experience" and thinking of Facebook in professional terms. </p>

<p>After you create a Page, you can add students as admins by entering their email addresses. This gets around having to add students as friends in order to invite them to participate. </p>

<h2>Group Blogs</h2>

<p>Blogs are a great way to expose students to online writing and basic web publishing. Students can post assignments for teachers to see, and the overall blog can contribute reporting to the local community.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Tumblr Screenshot" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/tumblr-media.jpg" width="300" height="193" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></span></p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a></b> has been in the spotlight recently for <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/tumblr_now_has_more_money_more_pageviews_than_word.php">its rising popularity</a>. It is elegant in its simplicity, standing somewhere between a Twitter feed and a WordPress blog.</p>

<p>Mashable community manager and social strategist Vadim Lavrusik uses Tumblr as the primary vehicle for the <a href="http://socialjournalism.tumblr.com/">Social Media Skills for Journalists class</a> he teaches at Columbia University.</p>

<p>"Because Tumblr is a social platform, other members of the community are able to follow and keep up," wrote Lavrusik in <a href="http://mashablehq.com/post/3329948902/tumblr-education">a recent post</a>.</p>

<p>Each student has his or her own account and can contribute to a collaborative Tumblr that combines everyone's work. </p>

<p><b><a href="https://posterous.com/">Posterous</a></b> is similar to Tumblr but has a few key differences. Its signature feature is the ability to post text, photos, or video by simply sending an email. Posterous also offers moderation and group blogs.</p>

<p>Educator Wesley Fryer posted a detailed screencast on <a href="http://www.speedofcreativity.org/2011/02/13/set-up-a-moderated-class-blog-on-posterous/">setting up a moderated class blog</a>.</p>

<p>Staci Baird also used Posterous for a mobile reporting class. She said some students were able to use smartphone apps while others could still post via email. </p>

<h2>WordPress</h2>

<p>WordPress is another free blogging platform. There are two ways to set up WordPress blogs. The simplest way is to create an account at <b><a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a></b>. It's fast and free, but also limited in terms of customizing its look and features.</p>

<p>Through <b><a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a></b>, the source code can be downloaded and installed on any independent web server. This opens the door to extensive customization. Because it's open source, it allows web developers to create a rich library of free plug-ins that enhance the core components. Journalism professor <a href="http://twitter.com/webjournalist/status/38290793890459648">Robert Hernandez recommends</a> the <a href="http://buddypress.org/">BuddyPress plug-in</a> to add social and collaborative features. Plug-ins are not available for WordPress.com accounts. </p>

<p>Some universities may allow WordPress installations on campus servers, but others have more restrictive IT policies. In this case, teachers may need to pay for a domain name and web hosting to run an independent server. It typically costs around $10 per year to register a domain name; server space to host a blog costs around $5 a month. </p>

<p>Hernandez runs his class blogs from a personal web hosting account. Multimedia lecturer <a href="http://twitter.com/jrue/status/38130776683982848">Jeremy Rue</a> uses the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache plug-in</a> to optimize the server load for self-hosted WordPress blogs.</p>

<h2>Social Curation</h2>

<p>As newsmakers engage on Twitter and Facebook, it's important that students know how to collect and annotate these messages. <b><a href="http://storify.com/">Storify</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.curated.by/">Curated.by</a></b> and <b><a href="http://keepstream.com/">Keepstream</a></b> all allow users to gather and embed social media messages for use in blog posts and articles.</p>

<p>As I was gathering ideas for this article, I asked journalism educators on Twitter about their use of these tools in the classroom. I collected their responses <a href="http://storify.com/modernjourno/journalism-professors-use-of-emerging-online-tools">using Storify</a>. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Storify screenshot" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/110222-storify.jpg" width="300" height="174" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></span>While Storify and Keepstream are designed around discrete collections of content, Curated.by is geared more toward ongoing curation.</p>

<p>For that reason, I suggest using Curated.by for student coverage of live events or for long-term collaboration. Another useful feature is that it allows multiple contributors to work together on the same collection. </p>

<p>Storify does allow users to share accounts as "editors," but I don't recommend this because it gives students full access to edit all content in each other's accounts. The privacy features in Curated.by allow users to limit access to specific projects.</p>

<h2>Collaborative Writing </h2>

<p><b><a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a></b> allows multiple contributors to write at the same time and track revisions. This service is simple and popular.</p>

<p>But beyond Google Docs, a <a href="http://bit.ly/bundles/nathangibbs/1">cluster of collaborative writing apps</a> may have a more practical use in class. In addition to allowing multiple contributors, they record detailed keystrokes. This means you can replay the entire writing process. </p>

<p>As an example, <a href="http://ietherpad.com/ep/pad/view/v0B5S9x0OO/rev.0">I used <b>iEtherPad</b> to draft this article</a> (you can watch me write it by pressing play). In math classes, students must show their work. Why not require students to show their writing? (For another example of collaborative writing on iEtherPad, check out <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2010/12/top-10-media-stories-of-2010-wikileaks-facebook-ipad-mania364.html">this story</a> by Mark Glaser on MediaShift.)</p>

<h2>Mind Mapping</h2>

<p>Mind mapping, or structured brainstorming, helps organize ideas based on their relationship to other elements. There are several free mind mapping applications, but one in particular offers a useful feature for the classroom: online collaboration. And like the collaborative writing applications, <b><a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/">Mind Meister</a></b> records all actions. </p>

<p>I used Mind Meister <a href="http://modernjournalist.com/2010/08/28/interactive-group-brainstorm-what-is-multimedia-journalism/">to begin a class</a> on multimedia journalism. I asked students to define journalism, describe multimedia, and organize how each element related to the others. The mind map tracked the updates as we talked about various definitions. It was fun for them to interact with each other, and it kept them engaged from their workstations rather than watching me write on a whiteboard. </p>

<h2>Experimentation</h2>

<p>Journalism educators need to lead by example and experiment. It's OK to try something that doesn't work perfectly. No tool is perfect. In six months, the sites mentioned here will inevitably be upgraded with new features. What's important is inspiring students to apply their journalistic curiosity to exploring how new social tools can further their storytelling.</p>

<p>If you have experience using social services like these in the classroom, I hope you'll share your perspective in the comments.</p>

For the next decade, people with disabilities enjoyed more and more captioned <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TV, </span></span>culminating in a 1990 law that required all TV shows to be captioned.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. When viewers tune in on their computers -- now the fashionable way to watch TV and web programming -- most of the shows are not captioned. Not even  "The Annoying Orange," which is <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/03/most-watched-web-series-october-2010/">the No. 1 webisode series</a>, garnering more than 50 million monthly views on average -- more traffic than for some cable channels.</p>

<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="500" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZN5PoW7_kdA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Just when the "legacy" TV and cable industry began getting into the captioning groove, accessibility seems to be moving backwards. With the rise of the Internet, video content is now moving online to meet the demands of always-on consumers -- and the captioning technology, standards, and processes must begin anew. New types of programming -- like "The Annoying Orange" webisodes -- are growing in popularity, but making them accessible for people with disabilities has been a low priority.</p>

<h2>Big Problem</h2>

<p>That's a serious issue for the millions of hearing- or vision-impaired Americans. In the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">U.S., </span></span>there are 25 million people with significant vision loss, and 36 million Americans have reported some form of hearing loss -- a number that is expected to double by 2030. There are now 75 million Baby Boomers who will encounter vision, hearing, cognitive and mobility disabilities as they age, and more than 1 million veterans returning home from a decade-long war -- many with physical and mental conditions. </p>

<p>As consumers achieve greater freedom in how and where they watch and listen to movies, dramas, sitcoms and sports, it is increasingly important that Americans with disabilities are able to access and enjoy this programming along with them.</p>

<h2>Solution in Sight?</h2>

<p>The good news is that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/10/08/remarks-president-signing-21st-century-communications-and-video-accessib">President Obama signed</a> the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act into law on October 8, 2010, marking a tremendous step in the right direction for these groups. This law amends Federal Communications Commission (FCC) policies to require that any program that has been previously aired on TV must be captioned when shown online. </p>

<p>However, the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FCC </span></span>only has the power to regulate broadcast, cable, and satellite TV providers. The lion's share of emerging programming is not covered under the new law and will not be captioned or described for people with hearing and vision disabilities. This includes hundreds of hours of online-only programming like popular webisodes (yes, including "The Annoying Orange"), YouTube videos, podcasts, and movies from Netflix, which now offers streaming TV shows and movies online and through devices like iPhones and PlayStation consoles.</p>

<p>Recently, the Department of Justice has been looking closely at the issue of accessibility, and is considering stepping in where the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FCC'</span></span>s jurisdiction ends. The <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DOJ </span></span>can amend the Americans with Disabilities Act to require websites to make their content accessible. That would be a heavy-handed move -- and they will not make this decision lightly -- but the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DOJ </span></span>has an obligation to protect the access of the 54 million Americans with disabilities to public goods and services, which includes public websites. </p>

<h2>Forward Looking Businesses</h2>

<p>Fortunately, some online programmers are voluntarily choosing to make their online content accessible -- notably, <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>. Netflix has also started to caption its online library (though it had dragged its feet for years.) Others, such as TheWB.com, which is owned by Warner Bros., and Crackle.com, which is owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment, simply ignore captions altogether. They do this because they can.</p>

<p>Once a cottage industry, emerging online formats now have the potential to lock the disabled population out of a huge marketplace of content unless new regulation or innovation -- or a combination of both -- spurs more businesses to embrace accessibility and its implications for future generation of Americans. </p>

<p>Even if "The Annoying Orange" is a truly annoying show, shouldn't people with disabilities be able to make that choice on their own?</p>

<p>For those who may have missed it, the dialogue was <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2010/12/why-are-new-media-conferences-lacking-in-minorities361.html">sparked by Retha Hill</a> in an Idea Lab post about the lack of minorities at new media conferences. Mark Glaser expanded the conversation from the comments section to a wider audience on Twitter with a MediaShift <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/01/are-people-of-color-missing-in-new-media-a-mediadiversity-chat005.html">#mediadiversity chat</a>. And Hill has followed up with a post on the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2011/02/people-of-color-must-innovate-or-die-in-digital-media036.html">need for media innovation</a> in minority communities.</p>

<p>All this got me thinking about my particular media niche: technology public relations. What's so special about tech PR? Well, for those loosely familiar with the PR sector, imagine it as music. Entertainment, fashion, beauty and sports PR are akin to pop music.</p>

<p>Tech PR is more like opera. It requires a slightly different set of skills and media approaches. How many people of color in opera can music-lovers name? Aside from the great <a href="http://www.kathleenbattle.com/">Kathleen Battle</a>, not many come to mind. Unfortunately, this dilemma also rings true for tech <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PR.</span></span> Persons of color are an untapped market that many PR agencies have not yet explored. Looking back at my six years in <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PR,</span></span> I can count the number of brown colleagues I've worked with on less than two hands.</p>

<p>Why are minorities -- especially those of black and Latino descent -- largely missing from the tech media landscape? Inspired by this new-found dialogue on diversity in media, I want to talk about my career as a publicist representing and working with digital media and technology companies and offer some suggestions for remedying the tech PR industry's diversity deficit.</p>

<h2>How I got here</h2>

<p>When I was about 12 years old, I accompanied my father, who is a professor, to a wrap party for a film project where he served as an academic advisor. At the celebration, I remember one of the producers telling me that I'd be "good at PR" when I grew up. Back then, I didn't know what the producer meant. But that seed of advice remained in the back of my mind as I graduated from Rutgers College (part of Rutgers, the state university of New Jersey), studied and lived abroad in Europe and Brazil, and completed a master's program in marketing from the Bristol Business School in Bristol, England.</p>

<img alt="ana cano nennig.jpg" img class=caption src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/ana%20cano%20nennig.jpg" title="Ana Cano Nennig" /></form>

<p>Upon finishing my master's program, I gravitated back to where my friends and family are from -- New York City, the so-called Silicon Alley of innovation -- and sought to finally discover what this PR thing was all about. Within a few months of my arrival, I landed an entry-level position within the technology practice of Euro <span class="caps"><span class="caps">RSCG</span></span> Worldwide <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PR.</span></span> It was there that I met my mentor, Ana Cano Nennig, a female of Mexican-American descent.  With her encouragement and guidance, I have navigated my way through the close-knit and competitive world of tech <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PR, </span></span>representing some of the most innovative and respected companies -- from startups to established brands -- that are advancing the tech and digital media industries.</p>

<p>As Nennig evidences, I'm not the only person of color to succeed in <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PR.</span></span> Minorities, especially African-Americans, have done well in sub-sectors of PR such as entertainment and sports where persons of color have played starring roles. This history stretches as far back as 1957, when the United Artists movie studio <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vieilles_annonces/3777444815/>hired <span class="caps"><span class="caps">A.S. </span></span>"Doc" Young</a> to publicize an interracial love story, "Kings Go Forth." </p>

<h2>New opportunities for Tech PR</h2>

<p>When it comes to persons of color in technology and digital media <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PR, </span></span>history may still be in the making. And, considering that minorities have led the way for technology adoption and innovation, I think a larger role for minorities is manifest destiny.</p>

<p>Take social networks and mobile technology, for example. New media and technology are widely embraced and used by minorities. According to <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2010/PIP-Twitter-Update-2010.pdf">a Pew Internet report [PDF file]</a>, 18 percent of Latinos and 13 percent of black adults who are online use Twitter; that's significantly greater than the five percent of white Internet users who tweet. Blacks and English-speaking Latinos were found to be more likely to use the various smartphone features such as web surfing and mobile shopping, <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Mobile-Access-2010.aspx">according to Pew</a>.</p>

<p>Given this history of early technology adoption and today's rising dialogue about minorities working in media and technology, I'm excited about what's in store. Smart business strategists hoping to increase their multicultural market share would do well to get on board.  </p>

<h2>How to promote diversity</h2>

<p>In addition to continuing the dialogue of <a href="http://twitter.com/search/%23mediadiversity">#mediadiversity</a>, I want to include a few constructive ways to address the shortage of minorities within tech <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PR.</span></span></p>


<ul>
<li>Weave diversity into everything you do. This is particularly crucial for PR agencies. One way to do that is by actively recruiting qualified minority talent, leaders, and mentors.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li>Create programs to help tell and preserve minorities' history in communications, as well as revitalize the role minorities play in the broader field of marketing communications. PR agencies can create an award or scholarship program to achieve this.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li>Educate minority youth on the opportunities in tech PR by partnering with minority communications professionals, entrepreneurs, journalists, and related organizations.</li>
</ul>



<p>The reason I enjoy what I do is because of what technology and media represent: advancement and innovation.</p>

<p>In order for the industry to live up to the ideals it represents, diversity needs to be realized not just at the consumer level but at the corporate level as well. More personal dialogue should be encouraged regarding what it's like to be a minority in this industry.</p>

<p>But more importantly, action is required by the leaders driving the PR industry. PR agencies that serve technology and digital media companies should encourage diversity in both personnel team-building and marketing initiatives for clients.</p>

<p>Such steps will help to create stronger and more creative technologies and media that are reflective of our nation's and world's undeniable diversity.</p>

Yet it is also full of the kind of discussions needed to remake and rebuild the industry.</p>

<p>Fostering those conversations is the purpose of the revamped New Music Seminar (NMS), the most recent edition of which took place last week in Los Angeles. The conference focused on the music industry's evolving economic models and gave artists a look at the future of the business -- from do-it-yourself (DIY) outfits up to the major labels. Tom Silverman founded it 30 years ago as "a new kind of grassroots music industry gathering for disenfranchised music business upstarts," according to the <a href="http://www.newmusicseminar.com/blog/about-us/staff/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">NMS </span></span>website</a>. (You can hear more from Silverman in <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/02/silverman-cd-sales-to-co-exist-with-cloud-digital-downloads035.html">Mark Glaser's <span class="caps"><span class="caps">Q&amp;A </span></span>with him</a> previously on MediaShift.)</p>

<p>I spoke with panelists, industry veterans, and aspiring artists at the conference. Here are a few points that were on most everyone's minds:</p>

<p><strong>1. No single product defines the industry.</strong></p>

<p>For decades the single song was the music industry's core product. Then for a few more decades the album reigned. The industry was well suited to meeting these consumer preferences because the profit margins were significant and selling more of anything in a single transaction is generally good business.</p>

<p>Endless choice has altered consumer behavior significantly. But with this change comes an opportunity to market substantially more products to fans. As album sales have declined, the industry now profits from a complex puzzle of revenue sources: merchandise, video, high-fidelity audio, karaoke tracks, song stems, artist access, and many other diversified offerings.</p>

<p>Today, there is no magic formula that works for all artists. Knowing what fan's preferences are and offering up tiers of products seems to be the winning equation.</p>

<p><strong>2. Don't believe the hype.</strong></p>

<p>Every year or two, a core trend is over-hyped and eventually disappoints. For years, it was ringtones. Likewise, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DIY </span></span>and direct-to-fan have proven to be more complicated and less  successful than expected. And the bottom fell out on music-based videogame sales, culminating this month in the <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-09/us/guitar.hero.gone_1_music-genre-air-guitar-guitar-center?_s=PM%3AUS">shuttering of the Guitar Hero franchise</a>.</p>

<p>The newest hot trend is cloud-based music services. In Silverman's keynote (as well as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/02/silverman-cd-sales-to-co-exist-with-cloud-digital-downloads035.html">his MediaShift interview</a>), the founder of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NMS </span></span>and Tommy Boy Records made it clear that he didn't believe these services will revolutionize the industry, as many are predicting.</p>

<p>The numbers just don't add up, he said. Currently, online CD sales are only down three percent from last year. Physical CDs still count for 76 percent of album sales. Clearly, people are not abandoning music ownership just yet.</p>

<p>An interesting fact Silverman pointed out is that music storage is actually cheaper than the bandwidth to stream it. This isn't a consumer-facing factor as cloud services typically don't charge based on consumption. But it may have a long-term impact on the financials of ownership vs. access: Unless the cost of bandwidth drops, cloud-based streaming services will struggle to compete on price with digital music sales. </p>

<p><strong>3. It's all about the music, after all.</strong></p>

<p>What the past few years have shown is that technology and clever business models mean nothing without music people care about. In his <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NMS </span></span>introduction, longtime artist manager Peter Malkin reprised <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7ANYvXP1hY">this video</a>, which lists the plethora of tools that enable musicians to run their enterprise. The point of the list is to show that there are a tremendous amount of tech platforms, but none of them really matter if the music isn't any good. Here's his presentation at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NMS</span></span>:</p>

<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="520" height="323" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/b2TkvDoeDRY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>I spoke to Malkin after his presentation, and he expanded on this point, saying that a great live show is still the most important tool in an artist's arsenal. A strong musical foundation is key no matter what tools one chooses to use, he said.</p>

<p><strong>4. New opportunities for artists at every level.</strong></p>

<p>A number of companies announced new product lines at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NMS, </span></span>many of which cater to artists interested in offering goods and services directly to their fans. It used to be only the biggest acts who had the resources needed to pitch niche products.</p>

<p>&gt; <a href="http://zmxmusic.com"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ZMX</span></span> Music</a> launched their direct-to-fan sheet music service at <span class="caps"><span class="caps">NMS, </span></span>allowing smaller artists to enter America's $600 million sheet music industry. They cater to artists that do not have deals with the major publishers (e.g. Hal Leonard) and wish to sell their sheet music directly to fans. The non-exclusive service evenly splits revenue with the artists and offers embeddable widgets that allow for direct sales across many platforms.</p>

<p>&gt; <a href="http://www.topspinmedia.com">Topspin</a>, considered the direct-to-fan leader for high-end artists, announced the launch of a self-serve model aimed at bands earlier in their career. A monthly fee of $9.99 and 15 percent of sales gives any artist access to serious marketing and sales tools.</p>

<p>&gt; <a href="http://www.gigswiz.com">GigsWiz</a> offers a ticketing system that encourages artists to actively sell tickets to shows rather than simply informing their fans of them. By sharing revenue, the service creates an incentive for artists to get even more involved in their show promotion.</p>

<p>&gt; <a href="http://www.jambase.com">JamBase</a> has expanded their service, allowing fans to connect via Facebook and be alerted when their favorite artists are playing local shows.</p>

<p>Other companies had launch announcements and platform upgrades, including <a href="http://www.mozes.com">Mozes</a> and <a href="http://www.soundexchange.com">SoundExchange</a>.</p>

<p>Just remember, as Malkin pointed out, these tools are only as useful as the music they power and the personal connections they are used to enhance.</p>

Mubarak and his agents were determined to silence the protesters and their message. </p>

<p>But, thanks to the valiant efforts of journalists and the resilience of the protesters they were there to cover, the revolution was not only televised, it was also streamed, blogged, and tweeted. During 18 days of sustained resistance by the Egyptian people, the world was able to see what real bravery is -- in real time. This is one reporter's eyewitness recollection of the revolution and the coverage of it.</p>

<h2>Dangerous Driving</h2>

<p>I flew into Cairo on the night of February 1st. I counted 35 checkpoints from the airport to my hotel on the island of Zamalek, where many journalists and diplomats reside and work.</p>

<p>The drive, which normally takes 30 minutes, took nearly three hours. After dark there was a curfew in Cairo, and every block in the city seemingly had its own distinct checkpoint. Most of them were manned by civilians armed with all manner of improvised weapons: sticks, poles, machetes, and even a samurai sword. These men primarily wanted to prevent looting in their neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The Mukhabarat, Egypt's secret police, had also set up their own checkpoints. These were the most frightening, especially for a foreign journalist. Last year, I was detained by the Mukhabarat. I was in Rafah doing a story on the tunnels into the Gaza Strip. While shooting street scenes in broad daylight, they snatched me off the street. I was held captive for 12 hours and it was not pleasant.</p>

<p>I was luckier this time and made it to the hotel without incident. After checking into my hotel, I tried to check Twitter for the latest information from Tahrir Square, but the Internet was still shut down across the country. Fortunately, cell phones were working so I was still able to communicate with my editors and colleagues.</p>

<p>I watched Mubarak's second speech since the "Day of Rage" from my hotel room. It was broadcast on virtually every channel. <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CNN </span></span>and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BBC </span></span>both offered a live English translation. He was defiant, stating that he would stay in power for another six months to oversee Egypt's transition.</p>

<h2>A Wave of Thugs</h2>

<p>Twenty minutes later I was on the streets of Cairo, producing a video for the New York Times with Nicholas Kristof. We didn't know yet that someone close to the regime was orchestrating a concerted, systematic effort to harass, arrest, and assault journalists.  </p>

<p>As Kristof and I crossed the October 6th bridge on our way to Tahrir, we saw a mob of about 150 Mubarak supporters rushing towards us. It was nighttime and they were some 100 feet away, so initially I couldn't tell if they were friendly or not. They had already seen me filming and probably suspected I was a journalist, so I just kept the camera rolling.</p>

<p>Generally in these situations, I like to keep the camera out for two reasons: Evidence and self-defense. If I get beat up (or worse), I want it to be documented. I am also a trained martial artist and know how to use my Canon <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XHA1 </span></span>to ward off attacks. (Don't bother looking in the manual for this.) My camera isn't one of those flimsy Flip cameras that are popular these days. It is hard and heavy and fully insured. It can be used for blocking punches, keeping a distance between me and a threat, or as my own kind of improvised weapon.</p>

<p>I stood my ground filming the mob as they swarmed me. They were chanting "Mu-bar-ak! Mu-ba-rak! Mu-bar-ak!" (I must say, the anti-Mubarak protesters had much more creative chants.) I breathed a huge sigh of relief when they went past me.</p>

<p><iframe width="480" height="373" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" id="nyt_video_player" title="New York Times Video - Embed Player" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/bcvideo/1.0/iframe/embed.html?videoId=1248069606119&amp;playerType=embed"></iframe></p>

<p>We filmed some interviews at the square, then left when an Egyptian colleague warned us that some dangerous elements had moved in.</p>

<h2>Targeting the Media</h2>

<p>I went home, slept, and woke up early the next morning to edit the material. I had to get to the New York Times bureau in order to upload it, since the Internet was still down. The Times and other news organizations used a satellite <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BGAN </span></span>communications system to get around the web shutdown. After filing, I met up with Kristof and headed back to the square.</p>

<p>Reports of journalists being targeted by pro-Mubarak thugs had begun coming in. Our driver dropped us off as close as possible to Tahrir Square, but the area on its periphery was where journalists were the most vulnerable. I felt a bit like a seal swimming in Mosselbai, South Africa, a favored feeding ground for great white sharks.</p>

<p>With my camera in a student-like backpack, we walked up to an army checkpoint outside of Tahrir. They didn't let us in. We went to another and were again denied entry. At a third, the soldiers finally allowed us in. Past the army checkpoints, civilians were also stopping people in an effort to prevent armed thugs from entering the square.</p>

<p>The protesters' checkpoint was security with a smile. A man in Levis jeans took my passport, frisked me, opened up my camera bag, and said with the utmost sincerity, "I am so sorry. Welcome to Egypt." </p>

<h2>In Tahrir Square</h2>

<p>Inside, it was like a parallel universe. I walked past a Hardees restaurant that was being used as a station for processing medical equipment. The travel agency next door was a prison for captured Mukhabarat.</p>

<p>Tahrir Square was the one place in Cairo where I actually felt safe working as a journalist. I knew that every single one of these protesters would take a bullet to defend me and my right to film.</p>

<p>As is the case in many revolutions in history, journalists become part of the story. The protesters knew that we were not affiliated with Egyptian state media, and thus were likely to depict the strength and righteousness of their movement accurately. They did everything in their power to help us (which in turn would help them). They fed us, offered us cigarettes and tea, and then posed for our cameras.</p>

<p>Western journalists knew we were being manipulated. But most of us didn't care because we believed in their cause. I didn't meet a single Western reporter who was not in favor of the revolution. Journalists cherish the same democratic ideals that these protesters were fighting and dying for. We were all touched in a very profound way and this resonated in all the reports coming out of Egypt.</p>

<p><iframe width="480" height="373" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" id="nyt_video_player" title="New York Times Video - Embed Player" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/bcvideo/1.0/iframe/embed.html?videoId=1248069611811&amp;playerType=embed"></iframe></p>

<p>I spotted Nawal Saddawi in Tahrir Square and we quickly darted over to interview her. Saddawi is an acclaimed writer and one of the leading women's rights advocates in the Arab world. In the middle of the interview, the frail, old lady nearly got knocked over by a group of protesters dragging in one of Mubarak's goons for interrogation.</p>

<p>But Saddawi is tough as nails. She recalled how she first protested against Nasser, then was arrested for opposing Sadat. Now here she was protesting against Mubarak with nearly a million Egyptians by her side. She claimed that this was the first time she could speak freely to a reporter in public. My spine still tingles just thinking about it.</p>

<p>I was in one of the many makeshift clinics in the square, filming a guy with deep lacerations all over his head and face from rocks, when I got a phone call from the Times' Cairo bureau. Two of their journalists had been detained by police. Anderson Cooper was beaten up by thugs. Reports of violence against journalists were now coming in by the minute.</p>

<p>The <span class="caps"><span class="caps">U.S. </span></span>embassy warned the Times to get all their journalists off the streets. They were planning on evacuating the bureau in Zamalek. The situation seemed to be rapidly deteriorating. I passed on the information to Kristof and we immediately met up with Stephen Farrel, another Times journalist in Tahrir.</p>

<p>The three of us decided that Kristof and I should try and get all the video footage out so he and I could start feeding it to New York from our hotel rooms. The problem was, our Egyptian driver refused to come pick us up from the square, saying that it was too dangerous. We didn't have another exit plan.</p>

<h2>Saved by Public Transit</h2>

<p>Fortunately, two young Egyptian students overheard our conversation, and offered to help. They said the best way to get past the thugs on the streets was actually to go underground. I was amazed that throughout this revolution -- with the Internet and phones and the entire country basically shut down -- the Cairo subway system never stopped running!</p>

<p>I took my tapes and stuffed them deep inside of my socks. I always wear hiking boots and long socks in these situations. I did the same when leaving North Korea. My precious material always stays on my person, either in my socks or underwear. I put a blank tape in my camera and labeled it "Giza Pyramids 1." </p>

<p>Kristof and I followed these two guardian angels down a staircase and got on the train. We made one transfer at Mubarak Station and then reached our final destination, Opera Station, where our driver was waiting for us.</p>

<p>We went to Kristof's hotel, where we bumped into <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CNN'</span></span>s Anderson Cooper and Hala Gorani. They both looked visibly shaken from the day's events.</p>

<p>As a precautionary measure, we switched Kristof's hotel room to another one checked in under my name. At this point, he'd already penned three strongly anti-Mubarak op-eds. I could understand why Kristof didn't feel safe staying in a hotel with the president's mug staring down from a golden frame in the lobby. </p>

<p>An employee of the now-evacuated Times bureau in Cairo brought me my laptop so I could edit from the hotel. Unbelievably, after all the difficulties that day, my computer died on me when I tried to compress video. I was so frustrated that when we were told to evacuate, I just stayed in my bed. "If Mubarak's thugs find me here, then it was meant to be," I thought to myself. </p>

<h2>Back to the square</h2>

<p>Sleep didn't come, but neither did the Mukhabarat. The next day, I edited my footage on a friend's computer and went back to the square alone.</p>

<p>I walked briskly past several pro-Mubarak gangs. When eye contact was unavoidable, I flashed a fake, friendly smile. I find that in these situations smiling is the best way to alleviate anxiety. More importantly, it projects positive vibes to the people who otherwise may want to harm you. Smiling and maintaining positive, relaxed body language is often the best deterrent.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean you should ever let your guard down. My eyes were always scanning 180 degrees for signs of danger. My ears were sensitive to increases in pitch or noises that would indicate violence. Probably due to the adrenaline, I could actually feel that my brain was processing data at a faster rate than normal.</p>

<p>I tried filming one of the pro-Mubarak groups, but within seconds was being threatened. One guy made a throat-slitting gesture and aggressively came towards me. I immediately assumed an apologetic posture, and said how sorry I was for filming.</p>

<p>He asked me in Arabic if I was from Al Jazeera. Omar Suleman, Mubarak's newly appointed vice president, accused the network of being foreign agents who were sowing the seeds of this revolution.</p>

<p>While I do speak rudimentary Arabic, I replied in English, "I'm American." My goal was to limit the conversation as much as possible.  </p>

<h2>Mass Bloodshed</h2>

<p>As I got closer to the square, I witnessed scenes of horrible violence. Molotov cocktails lit up the night sky. I saw lacerated, bloody faces. The air smelled of smoke; sour, rotten tear gas; burning flesh.</p>

<p>Pro-Mubarak mobs ran into Tahrir making male guttural noises and screaming. Armed with broken glass bottles, poles, and anything that they could find, it felt like a scene from a cheap, Middle Eastern remake of "Braveheart."</p>

<p>I was too afraid to take out my camera, and it was too dark to film with my iPhone, so I just watched.</p>

<p>Feeling insecure, I used another important defense tactic, which I call "meet and greet." I found a group of pro-Mubarak guys around my age and asked them for a cigarette. I don't normally smoke, but I wanted to create a feeling of camaraderie with them in case the situation got much worse. For once, I really enjoyed a cigarette.  </p>

<h2>Change Over Night</h2>

<p>By next day, the violence had waned considerably. It reminded me of how South Florida feels the day after a hurricane. The Internet was back on, the thugs were mostly off the streets, and a sense of tense normalcy returned to Cairo: I once again smelled the stench of Cairo pollution; drivers went back to using loud, obnoxious honking to communicate; street vendors hawked tissue boxes and Egyptian flags.</p>

<p>As days went by without mass violence, more and more people came to Tahrir Square, sensing that the protesters were on the right side of history. I even ran into many employees of the government controlled Al-Ahram newspaper. They told me that a similar mutiny was occurring inside their newsroom.</p>

<p>At this point, I was stringing for Time Magazine and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PBS</span></span> MediaShift. I bumped into some Times reporters I'd previously worked with and they told me that their bureau had reopened. I joked that it had been "a premature evacuation."  </p>

<p>The mood had shifted from anxious to festive. Celebrations peaked on Friday night, when Mubarak finally stepped down.</p>

<p>After his resignation, foreign journalists seemed as confused as the Egyptian protesters about what to do next. The common refrain among reporters was, "Where should I fly to now?" Libya, Algeria, Yemen, Iran, Bahrain, Morocco, China, and even the West Bank have felt tremors from the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings. Protesters and journalists changed Egypt and have inspired other uprisings across the world.</p>

<p>The Middle East today feels kind of like a seventh grade classroom: It's a rapidly changing place with young countries at various stages of awkward transition. These transformations are happening faster than reporters, politicians, and intelligence services can process them. As Egypt steps into a very uncertain future with the world watching, I get the sense that the Middle East's coming of age story may have just begun.</p>

<p>But wherever the plot leads next, it's likely that journalists, bloggers, and social networkers will be there to share it with the world.</p>

<p>Suleiman Abdullahi was recently an eyewitness to the birth of the world's newest nation.</p>

<p>In early January, the 20-year-old Kenyan journalism student flew to Juba, Sudan, to cover the massive referendum responsible for the creation and upcoming independence of South Sudan. As <a href="http://blog.upiu.com/2011/01/notes-from-juba-we-were-there-when-they-became-a-nation-1105">Abdullahi wrote</a>, he arrived in the prospective nation's capital city with a travel visa, a press pass, a story budget, and a 48-hour window to interview, observe, and report upon "the history that was about to be made." </p>

<p>By the end of his first day, he was under arrest.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.upiu.com/users/suleiman-abdullahi">Abdullahi</a> was part of a two-man student reporting crew hired by <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU, </span></span>a student journalism project run by the <a href="http://www.upi.com/">United Press International</a> news service. <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU </span></span>is an emerging player in the college media and journalism education arenas. <a href="http://www.upiu.com/">Its website</a> features a self-publishing platform for news stories and multimedia journalism projects posted by students around the globe.</p>

<h2>More than a platform</h2>

<p>The most standout aspect of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU</span></span>: It does not just publish content by students; it provides classroom workshops, story editing, and one-on-one mentoring to help their pieces sing. The students who take advantage of its services undergo what <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU </span></span>senior mentor <a href="http://www.kristakapralos.com/">Krista Kapralos</a> calls a "mini-internship experience."</p>

<p>It currently partners with more than 30 schools in roughly a dozen countries, leading to a cluster of student-produced stories touching on things such as Kenyans and antibiotic resistance, Moroccans and Christianity, the Chinese and homosexuality, and Egyptians and a revolution. The <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU </span></span>motto: "Mentoring Student Journalists Worldwide."</p>

<p>"We want to leverage <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPI'</span></span>s solid reputation to attract aspiring journalists and improve foreign coverage," said <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU</span></span> Asia regional director Harumi Gondo. "I've not encountered another program that has such direct communication and relationships with journalism schools around the world."</p>

<p>No contracts are signed. <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU </span></span>does not collect any revenue from the posted stories.  Students retain ownership of their work and are free to submit elsewhere. In the meantime, their content is vetted by professionals and considered for pick-up by <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPI. </span></span> Since its creation in late 2008, more than 2,300 stories have been published on the site. More than 100 -- roughly 4 percent of all submissions -- have been approved for placement on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPI.</span></span>com.</p>

<h2>Extra Help in the Classroom</h2>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/UPIU%20transparent-grey-logo%20225.jpg"><img alt="UPIU transparent-grey-logo 225.jpg" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/assets_c/2011/02/UPIU transparent-grey-logo 225-thumb-250x110-2909.jpg" width="250" height="110" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span>I can personally vouch for its potential. I have incorporated <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU </span></span>into multiple sections of my news reporting classes at the University of Tampa to mostly positive results. The process is five-fold: 1) an introductory video chat with each class hosted by veteran journalist Kapralos, who oversees <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU'</span></span>s initiatives in Africa, Europe, and the Americas; 2) an optional video session in which students pitch story ideas; 3) a critique from a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU </span></span>mentor on subsequent story drafts students post to the site; 4) a video chat round-up with Kapralos commenting on the quality of submissions overall; and 5) revisions by the students based on the feedback from Kapralos and, of course, their professor.</p>

<p>Students' involvement with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU </span></span>ultimately helps underscore the lessons I am teaching them -- if nothing else, the importance of a news hook, timeliness, editorial collaboration, and three-source minimums.  </p>

<p>It also has served as the platform for <a href="http://blog.upiu.com/2010/06/upiu-journalist-wins-at-religion-newswriters-association-440">award-winning work</a>. In fall 2009, Michigan State University student Jeremy Blaney earned a Religion Newswriters Association honor for his reports on local Muslim issues that were published on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU </span></span>and, soon after, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPI.</span></span> The headline of one of his pieces, which touched on the <a href="http://www.upi.com/Features/Culture_Society/2009/11/11/Youre-a-Muslim-Theres-an-app-for-that/12579646575612/">intersection of Islam and technology</a> was, "You're a Muslim? There's an App for That."</p>

<p>"When you're on our site, you're not only seeing students practicing journalism," Kapralos told a news-writing class during a recent video chat. "You're also seeing a lot of really groundbreaking work. And you're seeing it through a lens that you don't always see through the New York Times or <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CNN.</span></span>"</p>

<h2>Lunch, Without the Education</h2>

<p>One prime example involves peeling potatoes. Unbeknownst to many Westerners, a government program in India requires public schools to provide a hot lunch for all students. Since its roll-out roughly a decade ago, scattered stories from professional news media have been mainly glowing, focused on the positives of children eating at least one decent meal a day in a country where poverty and hunger are rampant.    </p>

<p>It took a local student journalist -- and five days of editing oversight by a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU </span></span>mentor -- to <a href="http://www.upi.com/Features/Culture_Society/2010/11/02/In-India-school-lunches-leave-little-time-for-learning/12887174387279/">help present the truth</a>. Shiv Sunny, a student at New Delhi's <a href="http://www.jmi.nic.in/">National Islamic University</a>, built upon his personal knowledge of the required lunches and close proximity to numerous schools to uncover the program's underbelly. In some schools, the teachers are the individuals required to receive the food shipments and prepare the meals -- forcing them to spend hours each day cooking, mixing, and peeling essentials like potatoes and carrots in place of teaching.</p>

<p>As Kapralos explained it, "The story our student found: Yeah, the students are getting lunch, but they're not getting any education because their teachers are spending literally the entire day in the kitchen." Another problem: Hungry students often attend school just for lunch, and then skip out on the learning.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/Krista225.jpg"><img alt="Krista225.jpg" src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/assets_c/2011/02/Krista225-thumb-225x236-2913.jpg" width="225" height="236" img class=caption class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" title="UPIU senior mentor Krista Kapralos" /></a></span>Admittedly, some students treat <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPIU </span></span>similarly. They use the site to gain a web presence with panache and ignore the professional mentors' editing feedback, leaving their articles' factual inaccuracies and grammar slips in public view. The operation also still screams young and scrappy rather than streamlined, at times seemingly run solely on the hard work and sheer tenacity of Kapralos. And the site's story template is somewhat restrictive -- sporting the same look for every piece and an accompanying photo slot that is a bit tiny.</p>

<p>According to Kapralos, template changes, multimedia add-ons, and paid freelancing opportunities are in the works. The <a href="http://blog.upiu.com/2011/02/get-paid-to-write-for-upi-com-1155#more-1155">latest call</a>, which is for student reports on Internet infrastructure, access, and control, offers $100 for selected stories.</p>

<h2>Back in Juba</h2>

<p>The first major freelance initiative was the Sudan assignment, which spun into action quickly as hopes for the referendum became reality. <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPI </span></span>president Nicholas Chiaia was a strong advocate of hiring students as stringers for the seminal event.</p>

<p>"He really sees the value in student journalists and he is not one to turn them away simply because they have minimal professional experience," said Kapralos. "He's the one to say, 'We need to utilize students, if there's a way we can do it that equates to responsible reporting and provides quality work.'"</p>

<p>Kapralos contacted two student journalists in Kenya whose previous work impressed her: <a href="http://www.upiu.com/users/abdi-latif-dahir">Abdi Latif Dahir</a> and Abdullahi. She assigned Dahir to Nairobi, where he covered the referendum voting of Sudanese refugees. She asked Abdullahi to fly to the story's geographic center, Juba.</p>

<p>Along with his "fixer" (a local guide), Abdullahi <a href="http://blog.upiu.com/2011/01/notes-from-juba-we-were-there-when-they-became-a-nation-1105">boldly charged</a> into the international reporting gig. He describes competing for stories with "thousands of foreign correspondents, each one eager to thrust their cameras and microphones at every passing local." At times, Abdullahi employed his "rudimentary Arabic" to interview residents who did not speak English.</p>

<p>Just before midnight on the day of the big vote, he went downtown to see if anyone had begun lining up. There, he said, an "extra cautious" security force detained him and demanded a curfew.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to do your work here and we appreciate you, but you must be indoors by midnight," the police told him. "After midnight, we really cannot guarantee your safety and we don't want your government breathing down on our necks."</p>

<p>In Washington, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">D.C.,</span></span> Kapralos was holding her breath. She had been trading messages with Abdullahi non-stop. He had been turning in all his reports on time. Suddenly, he had gone quiet, and a story deadline had passed.</p>

<p>"As an editor, it's one thing to have a story go missing in the melee of a major breaking news situation," she <a href="http://blog.upiu.com/2011/01/sudan-coverage-what-we-learned-1100">recalled</a>. "But when the breaking news story is in a region of the world where violence has been a way of life for decades, and when what you've lost isn't a story, but a reporter, stakes are high."</p>

<p>Fortunately, Abdullahi was released a half hour later, unharmed, and went back to work. He ultimately <a href="http://www.upiu.com/users/suleiman-abdullahi">earned three <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UPI </span></span>bylines</a>, reporting on the guns, flags, billboards, long lines, traditional folk songs, and ink-stained fingers of voters that comprised the spectacle of the historic referendum.</p>

<p>And along the way -- like his reporting partner Dahir -- he experienced his own unforgettable journalistic coming-of-age story. </p>

<p>"Seeing tens of thousands of people line up under the scorching sun with such zeal is a scene that is hard to describe," Abdullahi <a href="http://blog.upiu.com/2011/01/notes-from-juba-we-were-there-when-they-became-a-nation-1105">wrote</a> soon after flying home.  "When it's all done and the seemingly inevitable decision of secession is made, we'll be able to say that we were there when they became a nation."</p>

<p>And one frozen night in early January, within blocks of the house where Margaret Mitchell wrote "Gone with the Wind," Peachtree became more than a street -- an urban rebel christened it as an ice rink. </p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/18654578" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/18654578">Peachtree St. Ice Rink in Midtown</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user497871"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">A.N</span></span>endel</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>There's an old saying that when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. An Atlanta man named Andrew Nendel decided that when life gives you ice, go skating. </p>

<p>Videos of Nendel zipping up and down Peachtree between 11th and 14th Streets in Midtown Atlanta have received more than 200,000 hits and have been televised worldwide.</p>

<h2>The Back Story</h2>

<p>The Southern city that's been known to grind to a halt at a half-inch of snow got several inches Sunday night, January 9. A sheet of ice topped things off on Monday. Icy roads shut down schools and businesses for almost a week. </p>

<p>At about 2 a.m. Tuesday morning, videographer and web developer <a href="http://www.briandanin.com/">Brian Danin</a> and his wife Valerie were out walking near their Midtown loft. </p>

<p>"We kept saying, 'if only we had ice skates!'" he recalls. Then they saw Nendel. "Wow -- there's somebody actually with ice skates," Danin said. </p>

<p>This was the "money shot" of the city's worst winter storm in 15 years right in front of him. Even though Danin didn't have the gear he's accustomed to, he had his Droid X smartphone.</p>

<p>"It was one of those ironic moments," Danin said. So he held the camera still, braced himself against a street lamp, held his breath, followed the action, and then posted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iudRPyX4934&amp;feature=relatede">the result on YouTube</a>.  </p>

<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="520" height="323" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iudRPyX4934" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>"I knew while I was taking the video, 'Wow -- this is really cool,'" Danin recalls.</p>

<h2>The Viral Effect</h2>

<p>But he had no idea how popular it would become. "On a different one of my YouTube channels, I have 85 videos," Danin says. "This one video beat the other channel entirely within about four days. My mother-in-law from Colorado called saying she saw it on the news there." </p>

<p>Nendel, the skater, handed his pocket video recorder to a security guard and uploaded the result to Facebook, <a href="http://vimeo.com/18654578">Vimeo</a> and <a href="http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-539080"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CNN </span></span>iReport</a>. </p>

<p>"I never expected this video to go viral or become so widespread throughout the news community," Nendel told me via email. "I just made the video for myself to document the night I ice skated on a major road in Atlanta." But when he woke up the next day, it was everywhere. Media outlets all over the world picked up the clip. </p>

<p>"My video has gone international!!!! Hello Canada, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">UK, </span></span>and Holland," Nendel <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thepopnideas">tweeted</a> jubilantly.  </p>

<p><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CNN</span></span> Student News anchor Carl Azuz closed his <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/studentnews/01/12/transcript.thu/index.html?iref=allsearch">January 13 newscast</a> with it, saying, "Of everyone who's ever passed through the middle of downtown Atlanta, this guy's gotta be one of the only people ever to do it on ice skates."</p>

<h2>First Time Skating in Years</h2>

<p>Nendel, who said his schedule was too tight for a phone interview, put enough info online to paint a picture of how the night developed. He hadn't ice skated in years, but kept his skates because he wants to get back to playing hockey and maybe coach. The storm gave him an opportunity he couldn't pass up.</p>

<p>"When walking home I came up with the crazy idea of ice skating on the road in Midtown from 11th to 14th street," Nendel wrote on Vimeo. "The thickness of the ice on the street was just like a pond back home in Indiana and seemed perfect. I skated for about an hour while people walking by took video and drivers on the street were just confused." </p>

<p>People's comments summed up their delight. "Just awesome...saw this on the news the other day -- something bright in the doom-and-gloom-and-oh-no-we're-out-of-milk-and-bread news broadcasts that have been going on," posted one admirer.</p>

<p>"Would you skate over my way and bring me a few things i'm running low on...I still can't get to a store and I'm out of coffee and half &amp; half," joked another. </p>

<p>The video became emblematic of the pressure on the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-weather-mayor-said-801515.html">city</a> and the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/with-more-snow-possible-808965.html">state</a> to clear the roads and get things back to normal.</p>

<p>"I was a little surprised how long it took to get plows out on the road," Danin says, adding that, "the first plows I saw come down Peachtree Street were Tuesday evening." He saw the first one near midnight and snapped a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/briandanin/5435616729/">photo</a> -- almost 24 hours after Nendel's ice capade.</p>

<p>Nendel was surprised at how long it took as well. "After the video was posted and then viewed by many via local news, Peachtree Street in front on my building was cleared within two days," he says. "The rest of the street though took a bit longer."</p>

<h2>Clearing the Street</h2>

<p>That Thursday, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed met with reporters at the now-cleared intersection of <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/atlanta-weather-more-atlanta-803430.html">Peachtree and 14th</a> -- part of what had been Nendel's public ice rink -- to say the city had <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/atlanta-weather-more-atlanta-803430.html">ramped up</a> snow removal efforts. </p>

<p>What did Nendel think of that? </p>

<p>"I honestly didn't think much about it, due to the video being made just for fun and not to promote some awareness of the road situation in Atlanta," he says. "I believe the Mayor handled the press situation well and the town did what they could with what they had readily available. My big complaint about the roads is all the mounds of dirt and sand now left in the street not being cleared."</p>

<p>Nendel's <a href="http://www.thepopnideas.com/">website</a> says he works in ambient and guerrilla media, social media, design, interactive marketing, design consultation and print media. It also says Kelly Leak, a character from the movie "The Bad News Bears," was his childhood hero.</p>

<p>"Kelly Leak was a rebel, the cool kid, a secret loner, and knew how to get the ladies," Nendel's website says. "I look back today and still want to be that rebel I grew up admiring so much." </p>

<p>And has skating Peachtree brought him closer to that goal? </p>

<p>"Now that I'm one step closer with the rebel cool points earned by this stunt I feel this is only the beginning to the completion of my dream," Nendel says. "So keep an eye open at all times cause you will never know what I might try next."</p>

<p>I've always dreamed of a time when my community could come together with the help of our on-air and online collaboration. All it took was a blizzard to make it happen.</p>

<p>Mid-Missouri was hit with a blizzard-like storm that dumped 17.5 inches of snow into Columbia, Mo., and even more south of the city. The entire viewing audience of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KOMU</span></span>-TV was home and stuck inside. An ice storm had threatened to cut power across the region, but that didn't happen. Instead, the community was snowed in with power to their computers and high speed Internet connections. They were contained and ready to be engaged.</p>

<p>The <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KOMU </span></span>newsroom was ready. The staff is a mix of professional reporters and journalists who are still students at the Missouri School of Journalism. The managers of the newsroom -- who, like me, are also faculty members -- encouraged the students to step up and help out in the coverage of what was looking to become an epic storm.</p>

<p>About 40 faculty, staff and students essentially lived in the newsroom to make sure all of the newscasts got on the air. I gathered up multiple teams of reporters, who were then placed into different communities. Each team had a really nice camera and at least one person had an iPhone, Android or Blackberry phone that could shoot video and/or Skype. I had the reporters download a set of tools that would help them tell multimedia stories about their locations and how those smaller towns were dealing with the heavy snow.</p>

<p>My recommendations were:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://qik.com">Qik</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitvid.com">Twitvid</a></li>
<li><a href="http://coveritlive.com">CoverItLive</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a></li>
</ul>



<p>While we didn't use all of them, I wanted to make sure we were ready and able on all kinds of platforms.</p>

<h2>Videos on the Scene</h2>

<p>The reporters went out to their various locations, found a hotel, and got ready. As the day went on and the snow fell harder, the mobile reporters went out into the storm. They were looking at scenes no one else was willing to travel out to see -- like what a closed interstate highway looked like:</p>

<p><iframe title="Twitvid video player" class="twitvid-player" type="text/html" width="480" height="360" src="http://www.twitvid.com/embed.php?guid=29BNK&amp;autoplay=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>My favorite was taken the morning after the storm when one of our student reporters hopped onto a snow plow to survey the bad road conditions:</p>

<p><iframe title="Twitvid video player" class="twitvid-player" type="text/html" width="480" height="360" src="http://www.twitvid.com/embed.php?guid=KCBMK&amp;autoplay=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>While the reporters were out sharing their stories of the snowstorm, our viewers were at home watching every link, video, and live broadcast. When the majority of the storm was over, the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KOMU</span></span> 8 viewers took over by sharing many of their own stories about the storm. Our newsroom has an email address that accepts moderated photos into a Ning network. Hundreds of photos were sent to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KOMU </span></span>-- and that was in addition to the more than 620 photos posted to the <a href="http://facebook.com/komu8"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">KOMU</span></span> Facebook wall</a>.</p>

<p>The fan page was the centerpiece of our online interaction during the storm. A year ago, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KOMU </span></span>had fewer than 500 "fans" on the page. Before the storm, it was up to 3100. After the storm, it was up to 5500. Our newsroom has yet to use contests to encourage fans to join our page so this jump was huge. Along with the increase in fans, more and more people join in on the conversations and share on the page.</p>

<h2>Big Moment for Sharing</h2>

<p>This is what I've always craved as a journalist working in a regional market. It's exactly the sort of interaction I've taught my students to foster for years. I have always wanted open the line of communication and sharing with my news audience. This blizzard was the first time I really had that opportunity.</p>

<p>During the storm, I lived on my computer. I commented and reacted to every discussion for at least 36 hours. I slept very little.</p>

<p>My experience was not unique for the staff. My husband, who also works in the newsroom, stayed there for two days while I worked from home with our children. I had student employees who slept at the station and worked with me throughout the storm.</p>

<p>It was awesome and exhausting. But the relationships formed during that storm seem to be holding. In the two weeks since the storm, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KOMU'</span></span>s Facebook page has only had about ten "fans" leave the page.</p>

<p>The downsides? The amount of user-generated content we gathered was overwhelming. I wanted to make sure we had opportunities to share all it. Our anchors did stories about the content viewers had shared, and we featured the images and video by showing off an iPad on the air. I also had my students create collections of the photos our viewers uploaded. Here's our Blizzard Kids collection:</p>

<p><object width="400" height="300"> <param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fkomunews%2Fsets%2F72157625963832834%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fkomunews%2Fsets%2F72157625963832834%2F&amp;set_id=72157625963832834&amp;jump_to="></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" allowFullScreen="true" flashvars="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fkomunews%2Fsets%2F72157625963832834%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fkomunews%2Fsets%2F72157625963832834%2F&amp;set_id=72157625963832834&amp;jump_to=" width="400" height="300"></embed></object></p>

<p>The best moment? I'd say it was when our team found a woman and her son digging out the reporters' car. They were compelled to help by a Skype conversation during our newscast about how the reporters' car had been buried at a local hotel. The mother and son, who lived in town, left their house just to help the reporters get their car out of the hotel parking lot:</p>

<p><iframe title="Twitvid video player" class="twitvid-player" type="text/html" width="480" height="360" src="http://www.twitvid.com/embed.php?guid=H9ZRM&amp;autoplay=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>What lessons did we learn? That when you have a chance to engage, grab it. We used mobile tools to report and encouraged our viewers to do the same. We shared, we compared, and we were a true community on-air and online. I would suffer through a hundred more blizzards if it meant we could continue to share and collaborate like we did during this one.</p>

So why can't I buy most individual magazine articles in digital form just yet? </p>

<p>Selling stand-alone stories has seemed like a potential business model for magazines and other journalism organizations since the rise of iTunes. Observers hyped an incipient micropayment business model for journalism. But few companies have tried this model, instead offering complete digital editions and, whenever possible, digital subscriptions. The advantages of that approach are clear: packaging more into the product justifies a higher price, and loyal subscribers attract advertisers. Yet with the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/ebooks_ereaders_top_trends_2010.php">growth of e-reading</a> on tablets and mobile devices, as well as new options for processing small payments for content (e.g., PayPal, Facebook, Apple's App Store), marketing individual stories may soon gain fresh appeal.</p>

<p>Magazines exploring this option would have to maintain their brand reputation and their editorial voice by carefully selecting stories to sell and ensuring that they respect their relationship with existing readers. Recent experiments with selling individual stories show, however, that it can be done successfully. The only cloud on the horizon could be <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/219790/apples_new_subscription_model_pros_and_cons.html">Apple's new subscription service for iOS</a>, which demands that the company gets 30% of all subscription sales.</p>

<h2>Relying on Brand Strength</h2>

<p>Well-known magazine <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/">The Atlantic</a> ended its monthly publishing of short fiction in 2005, and now offers a single fiction issue yearly. However, the magazine, founded in 1857, wanted to explore other ways to continue its legacy of publishing fiction, and so recently finished a year-long experiment that made two short stories per month available exclusively on the Kindle. These were labeled on Amazon as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000463361">Atlantic Fiction for Kindle</a>. </p>

<img alt="atlantic_kindle final.jpg" img class=caption src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/atlantic_kindle%20final.jpg" title="One of the Atlantic Fiction for Kindle stories" /></form>

<p>"We wanted to recommit last year to being a purveyor of great fiction," said Scott Havens, Atlantic Media's vice president for digital strategy and operations. "It was an opportunistic play to further our entrance in the fiction market and to test out a new platform."</p>

<p>The Atlantic's access to established writers, such as Joyce Carol Oates and Paul Theroux, was a significant part of its success. Havens said the popularity of each individual story correlated to the prior popularity and "salability" of their writers. When Amazon customers searched for those authors' work, The Atlantic stories also came up in the results. </p>

<p>Overall, Havens said, Atlantic Kindle for Fiction "was a worthwhile effort, and it was a successful financial venture for us." The Atlantic is now working on new ventures for other digital platforms, and the complete magazine remains a top seller on the Kindle.</p>

<h2>Success of 'One Story'</h2>

<p>Clearly, The Atlantic's pre-existing brand strength and its ability to involve recognized authors factored into its achievement. However, smaller ventures can also establish a reputation for quality. <a href="http://www.one-story.com/">One Story</a> is a non-profit that publishes one story every three weeks in print format, and also publishes them <a href="http://www.amazon.com/One-Story/dp/B002LITH0I">on the Kindle</a>, where One Story is ranked 19th among bestselling magazines. </p>

<img alt="one_story final.jpg" img class=caption src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/one_story%20final.jpg" title="A recent One Story cover" /></form>

<p>Maribeth Batcha, publisher and co-founder of One Story, said that after just a year of availability, readership on the Kindle was as high as the print edition's readership after four years of publication. Kindle and print readers receive a new story every three weeks, representing varied styles and genres. </p>

<p>"There is not a 'type' of story we publish," said Batcha. "We'll really publish anything, but it has to feel pretty meaty and hold its own. It needs to feel like you've gotten a whole artistic experience."</p>

<p>The magazine will only publish an author once, and yet it still has a recognizable character as a publication. </p>

<p>"Over time, people develop a relationship with a magazine....It's not between the reader and the individual story," Batcha said. "There has to be some way you define your curatorial voice. People want choice, but not too much choice."</p>

<p>For mainstream, established magazines, this may be a major challenge in attempting single-story sales. Can a lone story express enough of an editorial identity to appeal to readers on its own? Editors must select stories strong enough to stand alone not only for their quality and timelessness, but also for their ability to effectively communicate to readers the magazine's distinctive larger brand and "curatorial" identity. </p>

<h2>Building a Passionate Audience</h2>

<p>One Story also counts on the audience's passion for writing itself. The magazine's readers, Batcha said, are "serious." The non-profit magazine seeks donations and is partly grant-funded. It has also organized writing workshops and encourages educational uses of the magazine to promote the short story to young audiences.</p>

<p>A new project that sells individual stories is also hoping that readers' support for substantial, long-form writing and its writers will lead to success. <a href="http://atavist.net/">The Atavist</a>, which launched January 26, publishes stand-alone, in-depth non-fiction articles that are longer than most magazine pieces, especially given today's ever-shorter features. The articles, priced at $2.99, are available through the publication's iPad/iPhone apps, as well as on the Kindle and Nook e-readers. Income from the stories is shared between The Atavist and the authors. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="atavist.PNG" img class=caption src="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/atavist.PNG" width="300" height="400" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" title="An Atavist story viewed on the iPad" /></a></span></p>

<p>"People don't think readers want [long stories]...but we thought there was an opportunity on the [smart]phone to give people this kind of story that they couldn't get anywhere else," said Evan Ratliff, editor of The Atavist and an award-winning magazine writer. "I do think there's a group of readers who'd like to support writers and creative people in general. If you say a lot of this money is going to the writers, [readers] know who made it and know where the money is going."</p>

<p>Ratliff describes The Atavist's approach as a "hybrid" between magazines and books. "We take some elements from one model and some from others. We're taking our editorial approach from magazines. We have fact-checkers just like at a major weekly or monthly magazine," he said. "We're taking a book approach in the way the story is told. It can have a nice arc to it, and it can have chapters more substantial than magazine sections."</p>

<p>The Atavist is not affiliated with a print magazine, though its founders are interested in partnering with both established and startup book and magazine publishers. There may also be advertising possibilities, though their style may depend on readers' preferences. </p>

<p>"Magazine readers are really amenable to advertising, but book readers are not. It's acceptable in one place, but not in the other," Ratliff said. </p>

<p>The Atavist is also part of a new Amazon venture called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=2486013011">Kindle Singles</a>, which <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1520181&amp;highlight=">Amazon says</a> "allow a single killer idea -- well researched, well argued and well illustrated -- to be expressed at its natural length," generally from 5,000 to 30,000 words. In addition to the two non-fiction stories published as Singles by The Atavist, Amazon also has published short story collections and novellas as Singles, as well as non-fiction pieces based on <a href="http://www.ted.com/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">TED </span></span>talks</a>. Amazon is taking submissions for Singles not just from the public, but also from publishers, making it possible that magazines and other established publications could sell individual long-form stories as Singles. </p>

<h2>Choosing and Packaging Stories to Sell</h2>

<p>One reason most journalism organizations haven't attempted a pay-per-story model, even in the form of micropayments, is that breaking news is available in so many places for free. However, these experiments show that readers may be willing to pay for timeless content that offers an immersive experience, as do long-form non-fiction storytelling and short fiction. </p>

<p>"You can't just take a type of article or a piece of work that is very similar to other things you can find for free on the web and ask people to pay for it," said Ratliff. "That's when people get mad. 'Why are you charging me $1.99 for this news?' We're offering a different proposition that offers something unique, that reads to you almost like fiction, except it's true."</p>

<p>The Atavist includes substantial multimedia in its stories -- such as photos, videos, maps, timelines, audio, and slideshows -- which smoothly integrate with the articles' text. One Story is also considering developing short videos -- such as author interviews -- to accompany its fiction. Right now, established print magazines have <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2010/06/magazine-writers-are-slow-to-take-up-multimedia176.html">little incentive to create multimedia</a> to supplement their stories, since most print readers won't go online to check out associated multimedia after they finish reading. However, adding multimedia enhancements for particular stories could make selling them singly more intriguing to readers and more profitable.</p>

<p>If magazine publishers can identify stories that provide rich, deep reading experiences, and then add engaging multimedia to develop that experience even further, they may be able to leverage their brands and editorial authority to market individual stories successfully. Other possibilities might include packaging stories on one topic together in one download, or combining stories from different magazines in a collaborative product. Individual stories or packages of stories can be sold through apps, websites, and vendors like Amazon or Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>

<p>However, the iPad and iPhone might become more difficult platforms for single-serve content if Apple keeps a large percentage of the subscription price. It announced a 30% cut for all subscriptions sold in-app, which has brought an avalanche of <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/02/apples-new-subscription-model-is-evil/">bad press</a> for Apple. We'll see if that deal holds, or whether competing subscription services, such as <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20032217-1.html">Google One Pass</a> pressure Apple to loosen restrictions.</p>

<p>Given the relative ease of repurposing digital content and the limitless possibilities offered by multimedia, magazine publishers may have an opportunity to reach a bigger audience on multiple platforms. If these ventures flourish, it will be simply because readers love to lose themselves in a good story.</p>
