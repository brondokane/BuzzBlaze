If you used the same password on Gawker properties and Gmail, two-factor authentication would provide you with more protection. I&#8217;ve also had two relatives get their Gmail account hijacked when someone guessed their password. I&#8217;ve also seen plenty of incidents like <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/when-google-owns-you/">this</a> where two-factor authentication would have kept hackers out. If someone hacked your Gmail account, think of all the other passwords they could get access to, including your domain name or webhost accounts.</p><p>Is it a little bit of extra work? Yes. But two-step verification instantly provides you with a much higher level of protection. I use it on my personal Gmail account, and you should too.

I was in grad school in 1999, and I remember that Google&#8217;s quality blew me away after just a few searches.</p><p>But it&#8217;s a misconception that there was no spam on Google back then. Google in 2000 looked great in comparison with other engines at the time, but Google 2011 is much better than Google 2000. I know because back in October 2000 I sent 40,000+ queries to google.com and saved the results as a sort of search time capsule. Take a query like [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=buy+domain+name">buy domain name</a>]. Google&#8217;s current search results aren&#8217;t perfect, but the page returns several good resources as well as some places to actually buy a domain name. Here&#8217;s what Google returned for that query in 2000:<br /> <code><br /> URL_1:http://buy-domain-name.domain-searcher.com/domains/buy-domain-name.shtml<br /> URL_2:http://buy-domain-name.domain-searcher.com/buy-domain-name.shtml<br /> URL_3:http://buy-domain.domain-searcher.com/domains/buy-domain.shtml<br /> URL_4:http://buy-domain.domain-searcher.com/Map3.shtml<br /> URL_5:http://domain-name-broker.domain-searcher.com/domains/domain-name-broker.shtml<br /> URL_6:http://users5.50megs.com/buydomain32/<br /> URL_7:http://users4.50megs.com/buydomain02/<br /> URL_8:http://domain-name-service.domain-searcher.com/domains/domain-name-service.shtml<br /> URL_9:http://domain-name-service.domain-searcher.com/Map2.shtml<br /> URL_10:http://dns-id.co.uk/<br /> </code></p><p>Seven of the top 10 results all came from one domain, and the urls look a little&#8230; well, let&#8217;s say fishy. In 1999 and early 2000, search engines would often return 50 results from the same domain in the search results. One nice change that Google introduced in February 2000 was &#8220;host crowding,&#8221; which only showed two results from each hostname (<a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-glossary-url-definitions/">here&#8217;s what a hostname is</a>). Suddenly, Google&#8217;s search results were much cleaner and more diverse! It was a really nice win&#8211;we even got email fan letters. Unfortunately, just a few months later people were creating multiple subdomains to get around host crowding, as the results above show. Google later added more robust code to prevent that sort of subdomain abuse and to ensure better diversity. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s pretty much a wash now when deciding whether to use <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/subdomains-and-subdirectories/">subdomains vs. subdirectories</a>.</p><p>Improving search quality is a process that never ends. I hope in another 10 years we look back and say &#8220;Wow, most queries were only a few words back then. And we had to type queries. How primitive!&#8221; Mostly I wanted to make the point that Google looked much cleaner compared to other search engines in 2000, but spam was absolutely an issue even back then. If someone harkens back to the golden, halcyon days when Google had no spam&#8211;take those memories with a grain of salt. <img src='http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p> ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/google-2000-vs-google-2011/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"86";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:10:"          ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"How to strip JPEG metadata in Ubuntu";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/howto-strip-jpeg-metadata/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/howto-strip-jpeg-metadata/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 07 Feb 2011 08:02:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"How to";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Linux/Ubuntu";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/?p=4431";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:351:"If you want to post some JPEG pictures but you&#8217;re worried that they might have metadata like location embedded in them, here&#8217;s how to strip that data out.

I&#8217;m going to try to address this earnestly; if snarky is what you want, <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/373135/february-02-2011/bing-gets-served">Stephen Colbert will oblige you</a>.</p><p>First off, let me say that I respect all the people at Bing. From engineers to evangelists, everyone that I&#8217;ve met from Microsoft has been thoughtful and sincere, and I truly believe they want to make a great search engine too. I know that they work really hard, and the last thing I would want to do is imply that Bing is purely piggybacking Google. I don&#8217;t believe that.</p><p>That said, I didn&#8217;t expect that Microsoft would deny the claims so strongly. <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/02/02/setting-the-record-straight.aspx">Yusuf Mehdi&#8217;s post</a> says &#8220;We do not copy results from any of our competitors. Period. Full stop.&#8221;</p><p>Given the strength of the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-we-do-not-copy-googles-results/8557">&#8220;We do not copy Google’s results&#8221;</a> statements, I think it&#8217;s fair to line up screenshots of the results on Google that later showed up on Bing:</p><p><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/google_0000.jpg" alt="Google Screenshot" /><br /> compared with<br /> <img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/bing_0000.jpg" alt="Bing Screenshot" /></p><p>and</p><p><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/google_0001.jpg" alt="Google Screenshot" /><br /> compared with<br /> <img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/bing_0001.jpg" alt="Bing Screenshot" /></p><p>and</p><p><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/google_0002.jpg" alt="Google Screenshot" /><br /> compared with<br /> <img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/bing_0002.jpg" alt="Bing Screenshot" /></p><p>and</p><p><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/google_0003.jpg" alt="Google Screenshot" /><br /> compared with<br /> <img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/bing_0003.jpg" alt="Bing Screenshot" /></p><p>and</p><p><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/google_0004.jpg" alt="Google Screenshot" /><br /> compared with<br /> <img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/bing_0004.jpg" alt="Bing Screenshot" /></p><p>and</p><p><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/google_0005.jpg" alt="Google Screenshot" /><br /> compared with<br /> <img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/bing_0005.jpg" alt="Bing Screenshot" /></p><p>and</p><p><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/google_0006.jpg" alt="Google Screenshot" /><br /> compared with<br /> <img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/bing_0006.jpg" alt="Bing Screenshot" /></p><p>I think if you asked a regular person about these screenshots, Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;We do not copy Google&#8217;s results&#8221; statement wouldn&#8217;t ring completely true.</p><p>Something I&#8217;ve heard smart people say is that this could be due to generalized clickstream processing rather than code that targets Google specifically. I&#8217;d love if Microsoft would clarify that, but <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2168332">at least one example has surfaced</a> in which Microsoft was targeting Google&#8217;s urls specifically. The paper is titled <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P10/P10-1028.pdf">Learning Phrase-Based Spelling Error Models  from Clickthrough Data</a> and here&#8217;s some of the relevant parts:</p><blockquote><p> The clickthrough data of the second type consists of a set of  query reformulation sessions extracted from 3 months of log files from a commercial Web browser <em>[I assume this is Internet Explorer. --Matt]</em> &#8230;. In our experiments, we &#8220;reverse-engineer&#8221; the parameters from the URLs of these [query formulation] sessions, and deduce how each search engine encodes both a query and the fact that a user arrived at a URL by clicking on the spelling suggestion of the query – an important indication that the spelling suggestion is desired. From these three months of query reformulation sessions, we extracted about 3 million query-correction pairs.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This paper very much sounds like Microsoft reverse engineered which specific url parameters on Google corresponded to a spelling correction. Figure 1 of that paper looks like Microsoft used specific Google url parameters such as &#8220;&#038;spell=1&#8243; to extract spell corrections from Google. Targeting Google deliberately is quite different than using lots of clicks from different places. This is at least one concrete example of Microsoft taking browser data and using it to mine data deliberately and specifically from Google (in this case, the efforts of Google&#8217;s spell correction team).</p><p>That brings me to an issue that I raised with Bing during the search panel and afterwards with Harry Shum: disclosure. A while ago, my copy of Windows XP was auto-updated to IE8. Here&#8217;s one of the dialog boxes:</p><p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/IE8%20suggested%20sites.png" alt="IE8 suggested sites" /></center></p><p>I don&#8217;t think an average consumer realizes that if they say &#8220;yes, show me suggested sites&#8221; that they&#8217;re granting Microsoft permission to send their queries and clicks on Google to Microsoft, which will then be used in Bing&#8217;s ranking. I think my Mom would be confused that saying &#8220;Yes&#8221; to that dialog will send what she searches for on Google and what she clicks on to Microsoft. I don&#8217;t think that IE8&#8242;s disclosure is clear and conspicuous enough that a reasonable consumer could make an informed choice and know that IE8 will send their Google queries/clicks to Microsoft.</p><p>One comment that I&#8217;ve heard is that &#8220;it&#8217;s whiny for Google to complain about this.&#8221; I agree that&#8217;s a risk, but at the same time I think it&#8217;s important to go on the record about this.</p><p>Another comment that I&#8217;ve heard is that this affects only long-tail queries. As we <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/microsofts-bing-uses-google-search.html">said in our blog post</a>, the whole reason we ran this test was because we thought this practice was happening for lots and lots of different queries, not simply rare queries. To verify our hypothesis, rare queries were the easiest to test. To me, what the experiment proved was that clicks on Google are being incorporated in Bing&#8217;s rankings. Microsoft is the company best able to answer the degree to which clicks on Google figure into their Bing&#8217;s rankings, and I hope they clarify how much of an impact clicks on Google affect Microsoft&#8217;s rankings.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the reply has been along the lines of &#8220;this is only one of 1000 signals.&#8221; Nate Silver <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/how-much-does-bing-borrow-from-google/">does a good job of tackling this</a>, so I&#8217;ll quote him:</p><blockquote><p> Microsoft’s defense boils down to this: Google results are just one of the many ingredients that we use. For two reasons, this argument is not necessarily convincing.</p><p>First, not all of the inputs are necessarily equal. It could be, for instance, that the Google results are weighted so heavily that they are as important as the other 999 inputs combined.</p><p>And it may also be that an even larger fraction of what creates value for Bing users are Google’s results. Bing might consider hundreds of other variables, but these might produce little overall improvement in the quality of its search, or might actually detract from it. (Microsoft might or might not recognize this, since measuring relevance is tricky: it could be that features that they think are improving the relevance of their results actually aren’t helping very much.)</p><p>Second, it is problematic for Microsoft to describe Google results as just one of many “signals and features”. Google results are not any ordinary kind of input; instead, they are more of a finished (albeit ever-evolving) product</p></blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s take that thought to its conclusion. If clicks on Google really account for only 1/1000th (or some other trivial fraction) of Microsoft&#8217;s relevancy, why not just stop using those clicks and reduce the negative <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/02/01/microsofts-bing-caught-copying-google-search-results/">coverage</a> and <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/on-googles-bing-sting/">perception</a> of this? And if Microsoft is unwilling to stop incorporating Google&#8217;s clicks in Bing&#8217;s rankings, doesn&#8217;t that argue that Google&#8217;s clicks account for much more than 1/1000th of Bing&#8217;s rankings?</p><p>I really did try to be calm and constructive in this post, so I apologize if some frustration came through despite that&#8211;my feelings on the search panel were definitely not feigned. Since people at Microsoft might not like this post, I want to reiterate that I know the people (especially the engineers) at Bing work incredibly hard to compete with Google, and I have huge respect for that. It&#8217;s because of how hard those engineers work that I think Microsoft should stop using clicks on Google in Bing&#8217;s rankings. If Bing does better on a search query than Google does, that&#8217;s fantastic. But an asterisk that says &#8220;we don&#8217;t know how much of this win came from Google&#8221; does a disservice to everyone. I think Bing&#8217;s engineers deserve to know that when they beat Google on a query, it&#8217;s due entirely to their hard work. Unless Microsoft changes its practices, there will always be a question mark.</p><p>If you want to dive into this topic even deeper, you can watch the full forty minute video above.</p> ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/google-bing/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"194";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:11:"           ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"Announcing the winners of the Kinect contest";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/kinect-contest-winners/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/kinect-contest-winners/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 29 Jan 2011 22:42:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"Fun";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Gadgets/Hack";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Linux/Ubuntu";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/?p=4689";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:311:"When the Kinect launched, Adafruit Industries ran a contest for the first person who released open-source code to extract video and depth from the Kinect.

It&#8217;s written by <a href="http://james.grimmelmann.net/">James Grimmelmann</a>, an associate professor at New York Law School. The New York Times called Grimmelmann <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/its-not-just-microsoft-thats-balking-at-googles-book-plans/">&#8220;one of the most vocal critics&#8221;</a> of the proposed Google Books agreement, so I was curious to read what he had to say about search neutrality.</p><p>What I discovered was a clear, cogent essay that calmly dissects the idea of &#8220;search neutrality&#8221; that was proposed in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html" rel="nofollow">New York Times editorial</a>. If you&#8217;re at all interested in search policies, how search engines should work, or what <a href="http://laboratorium.net/archive/2011/01/18/some_skepticism_about_search_neutrality">&#8220;search neutrality&#8221;</a> means when people ask search engines for information, advice, and answers&#8211;I highly recommend it. Grimmelmann considers eight potential meanings for search neutrality throughout the article. As Grimmelmann says midway through the essay, &#8220;Search engines compete to give users relevant results; they exist at all only because they do. <strong>Telling a search engine to be more relevant is like telling a boxer to punch harder</strong>.&#8221; (emphasis mine)</p><p>On the notion of building a completely transparent search engine, Grimmelmann says</p><blockquote><p>A fully public algorithm is one that the search engine&#8217;s competitors can copy wholesale. Worse, it is one that websites can use to create highly optimized search-engine spam. Writing in 2000, long before the full extent of search-engine spam was as clear as it is today, Introna and Nissenbaum thought that the &#8220;impact of these unethical practices would be severely dampened if both seekers and those wishing to be found were aware of the particular biases inherent in any given<br /> search engine.&#8221; That  underestimates  the  scale  of  the  problem. Imagine instead your inbox without a spam filter. You would doubtless be &#8220;aware of the particular biases&#8221; of the people trying to sell you fancy watches and penis pills&#8211;but that will do you little good if your inbox contains a thousand pieces of spam for every email you want to read.  That is what will happen to search results if search algorithms are fully public; the spammers will win.</p></blockquote><p>And Grimmelmann independently hits on the reason that Google is willing to take manual action on webspam:</p><blockquote><p>Search-engine-optimization is an endless game of loopholing. &#8230;. Prohibiting local  manipulation altogether would keep the search engine from closing loopholes quickly and punishing the loopholers&#8211;giving them a substantial leg up in the SEO wars. Search results pages would fill up with spam, and users would be the real losers.</p></blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t believe all search engine optimization (SEO) is spam. Plenty of SEOs do a great job making their clients&#8217; websites more accessible, relevant, useful, and fast. Of course, there are some <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/traffic-power-ceo-in-jail/">bad apples</a> in the SEO industry too.</p><p>Grimmelmann concludes</p><blockquote><p>The web is a place where site owners compete fiercely, sometimes viciously, for viewers and users turn to intermediaries to defend them from the sometimes-abusive tactics of information providers.  Taking the search engine out of the equation leaves users vulnerable to precisely the sorts of manipulation search neutrality aims to protect them from.</p></blockquote><p>Really though, you owe it to yourself to read the entire essay.

I also researched vaccines last year as part of my preparation for a trip to Africa. The research that I&#8217;ve done leads me to believe that your child is much better off getting vaccinated than not getting a vaccine.</p><p>Here&#8217;s some data points to help you make up your mind. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has a <a href="http://www.aap.org/immunization/families/faq/vaccinestudies.pdf">good overview of relevant medical studies</a> (PDF link), including studies of autism and vaccinations:</p><blockquote><p> The concerns regarding vaccine safety have received a great deal of attention by parents, doctors, vaccine manufacturers and the media. Dozens of studies have been performed in the United States and elsewhere. The purpose of this document is to list those studies and provide links to the publications to allow parents and all those who administer or recommend vaccines to read the evidence for themselves. The studies provided have been published in peer-reviewed medical journals. These studies do not show any link between MMR vaccine, thimerosal and autism.</p></blockquote><p>A lot of people worry that children might get too many vaccinations. The AAP talks about that as well:</p><blockquote><p>One study published in 2010 was conducted in response to concerns about the total number of vaccines children receive. In this study (the last one listed in this document), researchers found infants who followed the recommended vaccine schedule performed better on 42 different neuropsychological outcomes years later than children who delayed or skipped vaccinations. This should reassure parents that vaccinating their children on schedule is safe and is the best way to protect them from disease.</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s what the current research says. A lot of people have read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">Dr. Andrew Wakefield</a>, who was an author of a controversial paper in 1998 about the MMR vaccine and autism. I suggest you read <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/06/autism.vaccines/">this story on CNN</a> about recent news concerning Dr. Andrew Wakefield.</p><p>The summary is that the Lancet, the original British journal that published the study, retracted the study&#8217;s claims in February 2010. Britain stripped Wakefield of his medical license in May 2010. The recent news is that the British medical journal BMJ concluded that the now-retracted study was a fraud. The article about <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/06/autism.vaccines/">vaccination and autism</a> continues:</p><blockquote><p> Wakefield has been unable to reproduce his results in the face of criticism, and other researchers have been unable to match them.</p><p>Most of his co-authors withdrew their names from the study in 2004 after learning he [Wakefield] had had been paid by a law firm that intended to sue vaccine manufacturers &#8212; a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose. &#8230;.</p><p>According to BMJ, Wakefield received more than 435,000 pounds ($674,000) from the lawyers.</p><p>Godlee, the journal&#8217;s editor-in-chief, said the study shows that of the 12 cases Wakefield examined in his paper, five showed developmental problems before receiving the MMR vaccine and three never had autism.</p></blockquote><p>I understand that parents want to do the right thing for their child. My research on this issue leads me to believe that parents should make sure their children get vaccinations.</p> ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/vaccinations/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"97";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:9:"         ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"My predictions for 2009";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/2009-predictions/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/2009-predictions/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 04 Jan 2011 01:13:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"Fun";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/?p=4573";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:360:"Everybody is throwing out predictions for 2011, so I thought I&#8217;d do something different.

As 2008 drew to a close, I jotted down some predictions, but I never hit the &#8220;publish&#8221; button. Some of them weren&#8217;t fully-formed (or even complete sentences!), so I won&#8217;t print all of them. But some are interesting. Here are a few:</p><p>- &#8220;Market share for IE falls below 50% in some countries in Europe.&#8221; <strong>TRUE</strong> according to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-eu-monthly-200812-201012">StatCounter</a>. Here&#8217;s a graph:</p><p><center><img src="http://www.mattcutts.com/images/ie-market-share.png" alt="IE Market share in Europe" /></center></p><p>- &#8220;Cuil will be acquired by Baidu.&#8221; Definitely a <strong>MISS</strong>. This was an educated guess on my part. I didn&#8217;t think Cuil would do well, and someone named Greg Penner was on the <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/09/12/search-engine-cuil-is-valued-at-absurdly-high-level-of-200m-despite-flop/">board of Cuil and also a board member of Baidu</a>.</p><p>- &#8220;More people will realize the inevitable truth that Bill Gates saw years ago and that Apple has chased since the introduction of the ROKR: of all the devices in your pocket, the only one you&#8217;re not willing to give up is your phone. Therefore, all personal gadgets will eventually be subsumed by your phone. Camera? Already part of your phone. Pen and notebook? Quite close. Video camera? Almost there, give it a couple more years. Car keys, wallet? It will come. In five years, your phone will have fingerprint authentication and be able to start your car or pay for groceries with contactless/RFID chips. It&#8217;s all coming. In 10 years you&#8217;ll use your phone to authenticate yourself at the doctor, authenticate prescriptions, and store your personal health history, not to mention all your desktop preferences, bookmarks, browser add-ons, and keys to which music you have permission to stream or download from the cloud.&#8221; I call this <strong>TRUE</strong>. Most people now agree that your phone is a personal computer in your pocket. Back in 2008, not everyone realized this.</p><p>- &#8220;By the way, if anyone figures out how to lick the problem of satisfactory output/input, e.g. heads-up displays or retinal lasers and a virtual keyboard or something with as high a bandwidth as normal typing (and they will), your computer will migrate into your phone. Solving the input/output problem is one of the most important problems for the next decade. Witness the efforts that companies have put into pen-based computing and voice recognition, for example. Re-examine the success of some major products in the new light of better input/output mechanisms:<br /> - Google Maps: direct manipulation<br /> - iPhone: touch and multitouch<br /> - Wii: accelerometer and optical sensors<br /> Smart computer scientists and engineers should be paying as much attention to sonar, inertial, and optical sensing technology as they do to the change from hard-drive platters to solid-state storage.&#8221; Um. This one was more of a rant then a prediction.</p><p>- Here&#8217;s what I wrote back in 2008: &#8220;Canny self-promoters plus a few genuine believers will jump on the Facebook backlash early, either for privacy/personal information or for keeping Facebook&#8217;s data to itself. But unless the site makes a Beacon-level mistake, Facebook will experience massive growth in 2009, and the Facebook backlash won&#8217;t begin in earnest until 2010 or 2011.&#8221; Right now it feels true. Maybe we&#8217;ll check back after 2011 to see whether that&#8217;s accurate.</p><p>- &#8220;Semantic web technology won&#8217;t take off, at least not in the generally-accepted ways.&#8221; I&#8217;m going to call that <strong>TRUE</strong>. Remember how Web 3.0 was going to be the semantic web? You don&#8217;t hear that meme as much anymore.</p><p>- &#8220;The most interesting &#8220;savviness&#8221; test for me will be which of Yahoo, Facebook, or Microsoft let you freely retrieve your email with them into Gmail. Odds are that none will allow it, but if I had to pick one, it would be Yahoo.&#8221; A double <strong>MISS</strong>, because Hotmail did allow POP3 access in 2009. Meanwhile, I believe Yahoo still wants <a href="http://overview.mail.yahoo.com/enhancements/mailplus">$20/year for POP access</a>. I don&#8217;t think you can fetch Facebook mail using POP or IMAP.</p><p>- &#8220;Vanity iPhone apps.&#8221; This was a prediction that individuals would commission their own personal iPhone apps that collected their blog posts, tweets, photos, etc. The other part of the idea was that conferences would commission conference-specific apps. While a few savvy conferences have <a href="http://sxsw.com/node/4200">done this</a>, I wouldn&#8217;t call either trend widespread. So it&#8217;s a <strong>MISS</strong>.</p><p>- &#8220;In the same way that millions of people dropped their land-line for a cell phone connection, thousands of people will attempt to go digital by scanning their photos, ripping their CDS, digitizing their old VHS tapes, and scanning their papers.&#8221; <strong>MISS</strong>, I did a lot of those things in 2009, but average people didn&#8217;t. The brunt of the analog to digital migration will happen as data is &#8220;born digital&#8221; from the beginning. Millions of people will have physical photos stuck in boxes that they don&#8217;t look at much, plus digital photos on Facebook, Flickr, or Picasa.</p><p>- &#8220;Google Chrome becomes one of Google&#8217;s most successful products.&#8221; I think this is <strong>TRUE</strong>. (Remember, this prediction was less than four months after Chrome was introduced in September, 2008. Back then I was going out more on a limb.)</p><p>- &#8220;Breakthroughs in green technology push renewable energy closer to the mainstream, but not into the mainstream. As many people focus their attention in this area, unexpected surprises abound, such as the do-it-yourself solar roof installation or practical solar shingles. Expect to see more green technology scams as well though.&#8221; Meh. <strong>MISS</strong>.</p><p>- &#8220;Apple will weather the 2009 recession much better than most people expect as people continue to buy with their heart, not always with their head. More people will realize that &#8216;Once you go Mac, you never go back.&#8217; &#8221; I&#8217;m calling it <strong>TRUE</strong>. Apple radically outperformed the Dow in 2009. Apple has done very well competing against MSFT in operating systems.</p><p>- &#8220;Obama&#8217;s administration mandates that all federal buildings much use Compact Fluorescent Lightbulb (CFL) technology before his presidential term ends.&#8221; I&#8217;ve still got at least two more years on this prediction. If the mandate is for LED lightbulbs, I&#8217;m still counting it.</p><p>- I thought some public officials would start lifestreaming as the ultimate endorsement of transparency. That&#8217;s a <strong>MISS</strong>. Chalk it up to believing that politics would be different after the 2008 election. Oh well.</p><p>- &#8220;Microsoft will demo a snazzy new phone operating system, but it won&#8217;t get much traction, either because a) it&#8217;s not as snazzy as the iPhone or b) people don&#8217;t trust it to be as open as other mobile operating systems.&#8221; Given that this was a prediction for 2009, I&#8217;ll call it <strong>TRUE</strong>. Microsoft didn&#8217;t get a lot of phone traction in 2009.</p><p>- &#8220;Someone not officially associated with Android will work on an &#8220;iPhone skin&#8221; for Android to make Android look like an iPhone.&#8221; <strong>TRUE</strong>. Looks like that did <a href="http://www.ubergizmo.com/2009/04/iphone-interface-skin-for-android/">happen in 2009</a>.</p><p>- &#8220;Twitter&#8217;s 2009 business model consists of premium features that either individuals can pay for (at a nominal rate such as $1/month or $10/year) or that businesses can set up for self-contained twittering. The premium features include richer API access as well as some new features, such as the ability to save tweets to be posted in the future or periodically.&#8221; That, my friends, is a <strong>MISS</strong>. Although Twitter is now <a href="http://gnip.com/twitter">charging for richer access to Twitter data</a>, so maybe not a horrible miss.</p><p>- &#8220;Hacking of PC clients will decrease, but hackers will shift their sites to web server software. Massive databases of cross-site scripting attacks will be traded in the underground. Script kiddies will launch dictionary attacks. Anyone that writes their own web server software will probably be at a high risk of being hacked.&#8221; Overall I&#8217;m going to call this <strong>TRUE</strong>. As individual PCs become more secure, there&#8217;s a multi-year trend toward <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/gawker-hacked/">hacking webservers</a> instead. I fear we&#8217;re just at the beginning of this.</p><p>- &#8220;When Android opens premium apps, one of the big controversies will be developers who take great premium-app ideas for the iPhone and rewrite the ideas behind the app for Android, but without the permission of the iPhone developer. Expect flashlights, lighters, beer, farting applications, goldfish, etc.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure if this is <strong>TRUE</strong> or a <strong>MISS</strong>. I haven&#8217;t read a lot of complaints from iPhone app developers about Android app developers stealing their idea and writing their own apps.</p><p>- &#8220;Multiple people write a bit of JavaScript that site owners can add to their page to guilt IE6 users to upgrade to a new browser. Any browser, just something that was released after 2001 (IE6 was released in 2001?!?). The JavaScript code becomes a viral sensation and sweeps across the net. Whoever authors or hosts this JavaScript gains status around the web. Through the collective work of a bunch of savvy webmasters, SEOs, and site owners, IE6&#8242;s market share drops to 5% in some markets by the end of the year.&#8221; IE6 is slowly riding into the sunset, but call it a <strong>MISS</strong>. A few businesses will probably be running IE6 a decade from now for their internal apps.</p><p>- &#8220;eBay introduces spell correction for search queries which delivers a small boost for their profits.&#8221; I&#8217;m going to call this <strong>TRUE</strong> because the search [ipod touc] returns &#8220;Did you mean: ipod touch?&#8221; at the top of the eBay&#8217;s results now.</p><p>Okay, it&#8217;s your turn.

Here&#8217;s a few quick tips:</p><p>- Start the year off with an <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/gmail-inbox-zero/">empty inbox</a> in Gmail. It&#8217;s pretty simple to do: you assign a label for everything in your inbox right now, then archive everything so your inbox is empty. You can still dig into that label if you want to work down your email backlog, but it feels great to start the new year fresh. Follow the steps to declare a lightweight <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/gmail-inbox-zero/">email bankruptcy</a>, with the chance of still responding to those emails down the road.</p><p>- Do a one week (or one month!) <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/breaking-twitter-addiction/">digital cleanse by staying off Twitter and Facebook</a>. I think I&#8217;ve said before that if you want to fill five minutes, Twitter is a great way to fill 35 minutes. Sometimes I end up spending more time on Twitter than I mean to, so last year I took a week off from Twitter, which turned into a month off. It&#8217;s easier than you might think&#8211;why not try a <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/breaking-twitter-addiction/">digital cleanse</a> yourself? I&#8217;m going to do this digital cleanse for at least a while.</p><p>Also think about what you want from this year. Resolutions work for some people and not for others. But if you come up with even a single area you&#8217;d like to explore more, it helps you to recognize those opportunities throughout the year.</p><p>In 2009 for example, I went on 10-11 trips. When I looked back, I realized that they&#8217;d all been inside the United States. So one of my goals for 2010 was to get out to other countries more. I ended up <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/things-to-do-in-japan-and-thailand/">visiting Asia with my wife</a>, taking a work-related trip to Europe, visiting Mexico with my wife, and <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/climbing-kilimanjaro/">climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro</a> in Africa with friends. I wouldn&#8217;t have done so many of those trips if I hadn&#8217;t set a goal in the back of my mind.</p><p>So think about your goals for the new year. Lots of people want to get their finances in better shape or have goals about losing weight/getting fit. Speaking as someone who has lost 35-40 pounds in the last few years and kept it off for ~3 years, my main recommendation is to look for small changes that you think you can sustain for the rest of your life.</p><p>But you could also ponder all sorts of directions you&#8217;d like to explore. Maybe you&#8217;d like to work on being happier this year. Maybe you&#8217;d like to improve your skills. If you&#8217;re a left-brained person, maybe you could get in touch with your creative side by learning to draw, sing, dance, play guitar, etc. Maybe you want to practice being thankful, or widen your circle of friends. Or spend more time with family. You could even break your goals down into <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/30-day-challenge-poll/">30 day challenges</a>.</p><p>But I think the main thing is to do some thinking about where you&#8217;d like to go this year. It can really pay off. What sorts of goals do you have for the new year?</p> ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/twitter-email-bankruptcy/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"56";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:35:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/feed/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:12:{s:4:"date";s:29:"Sat, 19 Feb 2011 02:13:20 GMT";s:6:"server";s:10:"Apache/2.2";s:4:"vary";s:22:"Accept-Encoding,Cookie";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sat, 19 Feb 2011 02:10:21 GMT";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";s:14:"content-length";s:5:"18579";s:10:"x-pingback";s:40:"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/xmlrpc.php";s:12:"x-powered-by";s:22:"W3 Total Cache/0.9.1.3";s:6:"pragma";s:6:"public";s:13:"cache-control";s:41:"public, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate";s:12:"content-type";s:24:"text/html; charset=UTF-8";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20110128231735";}
