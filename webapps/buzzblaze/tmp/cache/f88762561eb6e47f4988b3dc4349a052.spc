And it&#8217;s good advice. You need to ensure that you are adding value with the content you are producing, with the conversations you are having.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just about the content, not just <strong>what</strong> you say, it&#8217;s also <strong>how </strong>you say it.</p>
<p>How you talk, the choice of words you use, when and where you use them, and how often you talk all contribute to how you are perceived by your audience. It&#8217;s a hugely important aspect of how you communicate online.</p>
<p>For example, the difference between <strong>WE</strong> and <strong>I</strong> has a huge impact on how your messaging will be read. One is more authoritative and suggests a bigger organisation. The other is much more personal, and explicitly tells people that you are an individual.</p>
<p>Language choice can also help you connect with your audience, or make you stand out like a sore thumb. Different people talk in different ways, and use different words for the same thing. I talk very differently to my parents than with my friends, I have different styles of speaking when I&#8217;m talking to colleagues and to clients. And I change the words I use when talking to young children.</p>
<p>In order to have meaningful conversations with your customers, you need to speak the same language, and pick your words carefully.</p>

Some entrust the accounts to a single person, others to a group of people, whilst some companies even have teams for single, specific account.</p>
<p>Having multiple people managing a brand&#8217;s outposts isn&#8217;t a bad idea per se; in fact for many larger brand it may be a necessity. But a user needs to know what to expect when they engage with these outposts. There are two options when you have multiple people managing a single account. You either ensure that these people follow strict rules about how to talk, ensuring that they are talking <strong>as the brand</strong>.</p>
<p>Or you allow each person to bring their own tone of voice to the account, but you clearly state that users are engaging with a <strong>specific individual</strong>. This can be as simple as appending their name to the end of a tweet or status update, or having separate accounts for these individuals.</p>
<p>You need to decide which approach to take to ensure you are delivering consistency. A common irregularity on brand accounts is that some individuals chose to say “we” and others chose to say “I”. On a single account this can get confusing, and leaves the audience confused as to whom they are actually talking with.</p>
<p>The solution is simple, clearly outline your approach; decide whether or not your account warrants more than one person managing it. Do some research, how big is your brand currently in social media. Are thousands of people talking about your products but no one from your company is responding? In which case you might to fortify your social media presence with a solid team of individuals. What are your long-term objectives for the accounts? What specifically are you looking to get out of your presence? Is it customer service, brand education, improving relationships or driving sales? How many people will it take to meet these objectives? And possibly most importantly of all, how much can you afford to spend?</p>
<p>Then decide who is best placed to be managing your profiles. If you want to be delivering customer service through twitter, then someone from the customer service department needs to be involved.</p>
<p>Then give these people the knowledge they need to properly run these profiles.</p>
<p>And as always, continually monitor and review your progress. If you are having huge successes on Facebook, but the level of engagement is being marred by only having one person managing the presence then it may be time to re-evaluate. And similarly, if you’ve put together a team of ten people to manage a Facebook page, but the growth hasn&#8217;t been quite what you anticipated, it might well be time to scale back.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the number of people you have managing your brand online depends on how active your consumers are in the social space, and how active you want to be with them. Getting the balance right can be tricky, but the first and most important thing to get right is to have a clear approach as to how you want to be represented online.</p>

It is what sets them apart from competitors. It defines who they are, what they value and how they act. And in a world where people can quickly and easily connect with brands online companies should be incredibly careful how they manage their brand online. And yet countless brand profiles across social media are being managed by people who are wholly unqualified to do so.<span id="more-15978"></span></p>
<p>Print adverts have to follow visual guidelines; TV and radio adverts have to conform to tone voice; websites are carefully designed to represent the brand digitally. All communications should be entrenched in brand guidelines. After all, it&#8217;s the brand that is talking, and a brand should have a clear personality, a set of values, and a way of speaking.</p>
<p>So then, why do we think we can ignore this with social?</p>
<p>We let interns speak for us. We hand over profiles to junior account execs, with no training, experience or qualifications. Few if any are given direction, let alone clear guidelines on how to represent the brand online.</p>
<p>Countless brands give away control of their online voice to their agencies, entrusting them to stand for the brand, its values, its way of thinking, under the at times misguided belief that they are best qualified. Very rarely are the agencies given brand training by the brand.</p>
<p>We wouldn&#8217;t let these people craft copy for adverts, or developing messaging for a television campaign, and yet these people are trusted to engage with consumers on a daily basis, acting as the official voice for the brand.</p>
<p>As social media matures, and companies are seeing its full potential they have to also recognize the huge dangers the face by trusting the wrong people to be their voice in social spaces. Companies need to carefully pick their brand guardians, lest their brand suffer the consequences.</p>

We are living in a brave new world where the consumer has the power over the brand conversation, and the broadcast model doesn&#8217;t work anymore. That&#8217;s all good, and you won&#8217;t find many people arguing the opposite.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just stopping the broadcasting; it&#8217;s about recognising that your target audiences are actually people. We need to talk to people, not just key demographics.  The reason the broadcast model doesn&#8217;t work anymore is because the way people consume media is fundamentally changing. We need to look at the shifting consumption habits when we think about how best to engage with these audiences.</p>
<p>The second you start seeing audiences as actual people and not just an age range then you realise that isolated channel thinking is ridiculous. How many people consume content from one channel in isolation these days? I watch live TV, read the newspaper and talk to friends on IM. And more often than not I do it all at once.</p>
<p>This is the reason that few social media campaigns work really well when they have been considered in isolation. People don&#8217;t consume media in isolation.  The most effective campaigns are the ones that are delivered as part of an integrated effort. It&#8217;s effective because it allows people to seamlessly move through channels, engaging with content when and where they want to. It&#8217;s effective because it&#8217;s a much more efficient approach to marketing, maximising the reach of your content through multiple channels. Social media needs to be considered in the broader communications planning, not in isolation. </p>
<p>Because others are always more adept at being concise than I am, I&#8217;ll end with a quotation, from the ever succinct <a href="http://bluurb.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/we-are-people-not-just-consumers-of-social-media/">Nick Gill</a>, that essentially sums up my somewhat rambling post into a lovely sound bite (it&#8217;s less than 140 characters too):</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumers don’t separate their consumption; why do we continue to separate our marketing responses?</p></blockquote>

One week it&#8217;s engagement this, the next it&#8217;s social currency that. And as much as I love a good buzzword, with a constant stream of new mots du jour it&#8217;s easy to forget what is really important when it comes to creativity. The idea, the piece of content, it&#8217;s all just STUFF. When all is said and done we are all content producers. We are all just making stuff.</p>
<p>Whether it is a social media campaign, a digital banner campaign, a series of TV adverts or print billboards, at the end of the day it is content. Content that conveys a particular idea. And when delivering these campaigns the idea should always come first.</p>
<p>An idea is channel agnostic. It&#8217;s a thought, a feeling, something that makes you stop, think, laugh, or cry. At the very beginning, before we think of channels or executions we need to think of the idea. What do we want people to think, feel and do when they see (or hear or experience) our idea? Why are we doing it? We need to base our creativity in strategic thinking, in finding ideas that a relevant and right, that are meaningful.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only once we have these answers that we should think about what is the best medium to tell people our idea. Will the idea be best conveyed through an engagement piece encouraging user participation and content generation, or perhaps a highly targeted digital banner campaign?</p>
<p>There are obviously channels that are more appropriate for certain ideas: certain elements are going to be best conveyed through video, other will get more impact with a print campaign. A lot of thinking needs to go into getting the channels right, but this comes after we&#8217;ve got the idea.</p>
<p>Channels are important, but they should never be the starting point. </p>

And so they turn to their agencies to give them “some social media”. There are two problems with this.<span id="more-349"></span></p>
<h3>“Please set up a Twitter account”</h3>
<p>Firstly, some agencies will literally give them what they want. They will simply set up a Twitter account for the brand, explaining that the brand needs to have a presence in this social space, to be engaging with consumers, entering into conversations. All that bunk. The problem is that they don’t explain why. Why should this brand be on Twitter? Why does this add value to the brand, and why will this offer value to users? Agencies fail to contextualise Twitter in terms of the brand’s communications efforts and their brand strategy. It’s just something they’ve rolled out because the client asked for it, regardless of whether or not it’s the right thing to do.</p>
<h3>“We want to make this campaign more social”</h3>
<p>Secondly, because the marketing industry is still playing catch to the huge potential that social media brings to the table many agencies resort to seeing social media as the gimmicky add-on to a campaign. To them social media is a tactical addition to an already developed campaign, rather than as integral to the broader marcomms strategy. Either they or the client have already developed a campaign and now they just want some social media sauce to go on top.</p>
<p>Like the brands in the first case, these agencies see social media purely in tactical terms, as checkboxes that need ticking. Have we spoken to bloggers? Did we set up a Facebook Page? Are we on Twitter yet? The danger is that agencies roll out the same checklist every time social media is mentioned by one of their clients, as opposed to strategically considering what role social media can play in their campaign.</p>
<p>Simply setting up an outpost on Twitter (or Facebook or YouTube) isn’t necessarily the right thing to do. In fact, without proper planning and being placed in the right strategic context it’s the wrong thing to do. So don’t listen when an agency throws a Twitter at your brand. Even if you asked them to.</p>

It’s got to the point where any <a href="http://whatthefuckismysocialmediastrategy.com/" target="_blank">randomly selected impressive sounding words put together in a sentence are being passed off as “strategy.”</a><span id="more-345"></span></p>
<p>There is an aspect of Emperor’s New Clothes syndrome about the whole thing. We go to these events where impressive sounding phrases are banded around and everyone nods in agreement. Hollow meaningless sentences are met with responses such as “Yes that’s exactly right” and no one points out that the phrases don’t really mean anything because they are scared that they’ll be branded as someone who “doesn’t get it.” And so we are all drawn into this pseudo intellectual speak, forced to speak this fake language where we all feel clever by saying a lot without ever saying anything.</p>
<p>This fancy language also enables people to hide their lack of knowledge and expertise in the area. A person can add a few buzzwords to a sentence and give the veneer of experience and intelligence to the lay man, but in reality have no real idea what it actually means. It’s bad enough that people do this intentionally, but the really alarming thing is when people have convinced themselves that they actually know what they are talking about simply because they can string these impressive sounding sentences together.</p>
<p>There is the argument that we have to add a certain amount of lingo to our language to ensure that clients know what we are talking about. But in reality all we are doing is talking to clients in a language they will not understand, demonstrating that we speak the language, and since they don’t we had better do the talking for them.</p>
<p>It’s a shrewd business model; after all, as Andrew Davis said, “Where there is confusion, there is money to be made.” It’s this fear that clients will see what we do as simple that is driving this desire to make the problems that we solve for clients sound more complex than they actually are.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the problem we try to solve, the real aim of marketing, be it digital, social or otherwise, is to talk to people, and hopefully, on occasion, get them to talk back. That’s it. It’s not a complex problem. But this doesn’t mean that the solutions are easy, of course they aren’t. The solutions are the brand planning, the communications approach, the strategy, and of course, great tactical executions. Looking at advertising in particular as an example, the specific problem they are trying to solve is to get awareness of a message, be it about a product, a service, or a brand. That is a simple, easily understandable problem. The difficulty comes in getting the right ad to deliver that message. It’s a complex and difficult thing to get right, which is why truly great brands and campaigns are rare. We shouldn’t be spending time trying to make the problem sound more complex, we should be demonstrating that finding the perfect, tailored solution to the problem is where we add value.</p>
<p>As an industry we are so focussed on intellectualising what marketing is trying to do, rather than actually doing it. If we spent as much time developing strategies as we do trying to come up with new definitions for things, and clever ways of saying simple things just imagine how the world of marketing would progress.</p>

And the reason is mind numbingly obvious, the reason they have no idea what they’re doing is because they aren’t active users themselves. It’s no surprise that people that don’t actively participate in social media struggle to come up with ways to engage users, or worse, do things that make active users cringe in disbelief.<span id="more-333"></span></p>
<p>If you aren’t involved in social media then you will lack a fundamental understanding of what it is about. Planning a campaign is all about trying to get inside the heads of your audience, understand their motivators and behaviours are to ensure that you deliver a campaign that is relevant and compelling. But developing a social media strategy without being actively involved is like trying to be a priest without believing in God, or knowing what religion is. (thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/darrenvernall" target="_blank">Darren</a> for the metaphor)</p>
<p>When trying to figure ways to engage with bloggers the best tool at your display is firsthand knowledge of bloggers. The best way to get into the mindset of a blogger is to actually become one. Want to understand Twitter users? Then use Twitter!</p>
<p>Sure ideally we would want firsthand knowledge of all of our user groups when developing a strategy, but a lot of the time it’s unrealistic for a planner to have a deep understanding of everything the audience has experienced. But there really is no excuse for not being active in social media. It’s easy to set up a blog, write a few posts, and get a feel for the medium. Then when you ask the question “why would bloggers be interested in this campaign?” you can answer it, because you are to some extent, a blogger.</p>
<p>The concern is that so many people seem to be “working in social media”, with only a basic understanding of what social media is. Until you started actively getting involved, living in social media, then you will nearly always fail to understand it. Chances are you will see social media merely as a set of tools that some people use, without really knowing why.</p>
<p>If you work in social media, talk about social media strategies or try to sell social media campaigns to your clients, then you need to be actively participating in it. At best you are a liar and will only be able to deliver mediocre tried and tested campaigns, at worst you are a conman and will end up damaging the brands of your clients.</p>

Facebook for example allows you to create a brand presence in a social space, allowing fans a deeper connection with the brand than ever before.</p>
<p>However, this new opportunity also brings with it challenges. What if fans of your brand speak more than one language and live in more than one country? Obviously you can’t communicate with people in a language they don’t speak, and also, it’s difficult to be relevant to users when you are trying to talk to users of multiple territories at once.<span id="more-321"></span></p>
<p>More and more it seems the default response is to completely separate the communications approach. Many brands choose to create completely separate accounts and pages for different territories and languages. On the face of it this solves the problem; different accounts solve any language barriers and ensure the content is relevant to each of the different territories.</p>
<p>There is an issue with ensuring that every communication is on brand and on message, but there is a bigger issue. As a fan of Product X people don’t want to communicate with Product X UK, they want to communicate directly with Product X. This can be seen from the fact that brands with one single page will have more fans than competitor brands with different pages for each territory, even when you combine the totals for the territories. Customers want to know they are talking to THE official brand page, and territory specific pages get in the way of this.</p>
<p>As Facebook has evolved, the need for separate accounts has diminished. In particular, targeted wall geoposting and location specific tab content allows the end user to get the tailored content the brand wants them to see, in a language they can understand, but with a brand identity they want to connect with. Using these features you can do away with the need for separate pages for the territories and have a single destination for your global brand on Facebook.</p>
<p><em>A note on other platforms</em><em><br />
Of course other social media platforms are a way off this, with the notable example of Twitter, which does not allow this kind of targeted communication.</em></p>

Until you can show the value of those users they are just meaningless numbers.</p>
<p>Social media marketing is full of metrics that can impress clients such as follower count, but until they are put in context they mean absolutely nothing. If your Twitter account has 1000 followers that may seem good, but when you some research and find that all of your competitors have at least 3,000 followers, the sheen wears off.<span id="more-314"></span></p>
<p>These numbers are used to agencies to show their work as being successful. It&#8217;s largely a runoff from the social media industry being co-opted by the PR world, obsessed with hollow figures such as opportunities to see. They see the number of followers a brand has a direct translation to opportunity to see brand messages. They promise that they can get a Facebook fan page X number of followers in X amount of time, and because it&#8217;s relatively easy to do so, they can deliver. And so they give the impression they&#8217;ve been successful because they&#8217;ve delivered what they told you they would. This does not mean that it&#8217;s been a successful social media campaign though, far from it.</p>
<p>If they aren&#8217;t engaging with users, having conversations, learning what consumers think and want then ultimately it&#8217;s a failure. So what if every time you put out a message 1000 people have the opportunity to see it, if no one cares about, understands or wants to see the message, then it&#8217;s pointless. Just as pointless (and potentially dangerous) as getting PR coverage about a new burger in a vegetarian magazine would be.</p>
<p>Social media isn&#8217;t just about reach, it&#8217;s about engagement. Until you start putting follower numbers into context, and showing the value of these followers then they&#8217;re just meaningless numbers.</p>
