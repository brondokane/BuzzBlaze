<p>Once the report is available, I will let you know where you can download it -- Jim Storer and Rachel Happe tell me this year it will be even bigger than last.</p>
<p>It has been a big year for the role of community manager.</p>
<p>One of the struggles for community managers last year was <strong>how to communicate and build support for their strategies - not in building the strategy itself</strong>.</p>
<p>From last year's report: <em>Proving business results and understanding the cost/results of community initiatives is part and parcel of building internal support. </em></p>
<p><em>This analysis has gotten easier as more companies have shared their experiences, but it can still often be a chicken and egg exercise, particularly because communities typically require a lot of investment before results start to accrue</em>.</p>
<p>In customer support situations, you can measure:</p>
<ul>
<li>call avoidance</li>
<li>reduced average support costs per customer</li>
<li>increased customer satisfaction</li>
<li>reduced investment in support documentation and training</li>
<li>reduction in customer attrition</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the biggest difference you can make is in <strong>gaining internal support for customers</strong>. To <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2011/01/be-social-to-drive-social.html" target="_blank" title="Be Social to Drive Social Effectively">drive social effectively, you need to be social</a> inside your organization. This is an opportunity for community managers to partner with customer support and also operations people.</p>
<p>Select lessons learned by Community Roundtable members last year are (in the <a href="http://community-roundtable.com/socm-2010/" target="_blank">2010 report</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are having difficulty getting others to buy-in to using tools to help you create content, use the tools on them first. For instance, interview them with Flip cams and use the content internally. This is safe, fun and evangelizes the concept.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The three most important business tools for social tool management are listening, analytics and account management.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sentiment analysis tools should be used as a filter, not for precision or direct response. They improve over time as they are ‘trained’, but are never 100% accurate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Examples of companies that are doing a good job of generating fan-only content on Facebook vs. company-created content are Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Vitamin Water, HP and Dell.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found that the <strong>best way to gain support for customers is by making all customer-facing groups accountable for reporting and measurement</strong>, and then creating a master dashboard to share internally. I've seen some really good ones from CPG companies.</p>
<p>What you want to track are:</p>
<ol>
<li>inbound calls -- volume as well as qualitative information about the reason why people call. In a past company, we found that customers were calling to learn about additional services, compare your costs with customer retention programs</li>
<li>community activity on your own sites and in outposts -- did you implement a chat service on your site? That might save you from a Twitter discussion, for example, keep things running smoothly</li>
<li>ratings and reviews -- you should consider enabling those directly o<a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2008/09/showing-customer-reviews-on-your-site.html" target="_blank" title="Showing Customer Reviews on Your Site">n your Web properties</a> rather than having customers spread them on retailer sites, for example</li>
<li><a href="http://forums.bestbuy.com/" target="_blank" title="this is Best Buy, as an example">community forums</a> where customers can help each other -- and you will need to monitor <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/bestbuy" target="_blank" title="Best Buy has a page here as well">Get Satisfaction</a> as well [Best Buy example links]</li>
<li>internal communities for signs of employee dissatisfaction, which will impact customer attrition -- and you will see those signs also on external sites like <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Best-Buy-Reviews-E97.htm" target="_blank" title="this is the profile for Best Buy">Glassdoor </a></li>
</ol>
<p>Reviews, ratings, forums, communities, and third party sites will give you <strong>a general sense of the conversations about your company and the sentiment</strong>. If there isn't a lot of conversation, you will need to exclude neutral sentiment and highlight the ration between negative and positive in initial reports.</p>
<p>A <strong>regular report with annotations about significant changes</strong> -- maybe the top three important take aways from the data, along with qualitative information, will get you started on building internal support for customer-facing communications and on your way to helping make operational changes where needed. Because you will be able to justify the costs of not investing.</p>
<p>Customers need a voice inside the organization, and community managers have the opportunity to give them one.</p>

During recent events, the magazine developed a format that allowed it to explain the news and events taking place in places like Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Wisconsin. As Nieman Labs outlines, three million unique users visited the site — a 420 percent increase from February 2010’s numbers. And MotherJones.com posted 6.6 million pageviews overall — a 275 percent increase. In all, the mag estimates, a cumulative 29 percent of traffic to MotherJones.com came from social media sites. I'm thinking you would be happy with a fraction of that traffic. The credit goes to context-based content created in a way that allowed entry points for the community interested in the topic, and created permission for the news organization. A win-win situation. The press is going more and more direct to readers. Celebrities are doing the same with their fans. This past week, Charlie Sheen broke all the rules, got rid of both the press and PR, and went directly to his fans. He got himself a Ustream channel and will be taking advantage of real time live streaming. He already has an audience. From defensive to proactive PR Delivering reputation management and value requires shifting your stance from defensive to proactive public relations.

<p>You should read the post about how <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/03/mother-jones-web-traffic-up-400-percent-partly-thanks-to-explainers/" target="_blank">Mother Jones Web traffic shot up by 400 percent</a> recently, especially if you're in public relationship at an organization. During recent events, the magazine developed a <strong>format that allowed it to explain the news and events taking place</strong> in places like Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>As Nieman Labs outlines, <em>three million unique users visited the site — a 420 percent increase from February 2010’s numbers. And <a href="http://motherjones.com/">MotherJones.com</a> posted 6.6 million pageviews overall — a 275 percent increase</em>. <em>In all, the mag estimates, a cumulative 29 percent of traffic to MotherJones.com came from social media sites</em>. I'm thinking you would be happy with a fraction of that traffic.</p>
<p>The credit goes to context-based content created in a way that allowed entry points for the community interested in the topic, and created permission for the news organization. A win-win situation. The press is going more and more direct to readers.</p>
<p>Celebrities are doing the same with their fans. This past week, <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2011/03/05/are-we-witnessing-youtubes-big-fumble/" target="_blank">Charlie Sheen broke all the rules</a>, got rid of both the press and PR, and went directly to his fans. He got himself a <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/charliesheen" target="_blank">Ustream channel</a> and will be taking advantage of real time live streaming. He already has an audience.</p>
<h2><strong>From defensive to proactive PR</strong></h2>
<p>Delivering <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2011/01/reputation-management-and-value.html" target="_blank" title="Reputation Management and Value">reputation management and value</a> requires <strong>shifting your stance from defensive to proactive public relations</strong>. Capitalizing on immediacy is not the same as putting out fires. A defensive strategy does include carefully scripted press releases.</p>
<p>What is Charlie Sheen doing? Instead of getting defensive and hiding behind a no comment wall, he's taking his story directly to his fans. By creating a channel of his own at a time when he is newsworthy, he's taking advantage of immediacy. Yes, comments are all over the map, yet by and large he is winning attention and getting his message out.</p>
<p>You would probably not do the same thing if one of the executives in your organization did something really bad. There is however a lesson in how Steve Jobs handles issues of that kind at Apple -- swift action is taken on the executive, the message focus remains the product(s).</p>
<h2><strong>Immediacy in topical news</strong></h2>
<p>If you're not planning a course of action to explain topical news and show your expertise, <strong>you're leaving money on the table</strong>. We now have plenty of examples of how it's done from news organizations, government agencies, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/acarvin" target="_blank">Andy Carvin</a> has been sharing and curating news of the unrest in Egypt and Libya while vetting it in a public Twitter stream -- a modern correspondent representing himself and <em>NPR</em></li>
<li><a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2009/12/how-a-journalist-engages-fans.html" target="_blank" title="How a Journalist Engages Fans">Nick Kristof has been reporting</a> directly to his fans on behalf of the <em>New York Times</em></li>
<li><em>Mother Jones </em>has done some explaining for people interested in recent events -- quoting from the Nieman Lab's post, the <em>news material catered to readers’ immediate need for context and  understanding when it comes to complex, and time-sensitive, situations.  The pages’ currency, in other words, is currency itself</em></li>
<li><a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/" target="_blank">Nieman Lab</a> is curating information about innovative ways to handle media and news</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/CDCEmergency" target="_blank">CDC Emergency</a> started a Twitter stream to inform the public about pandemic outbreaks and <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2009/04/how-do-you-build-value-with-micro-updates-for-a-timestarved-informationintensive-world.html" target="_blank" title="How do You Build Value with Micro Updates for a Time-Starved, Information-Intensive World?">build tremendous value with micro updates</a> -- you will see its follower count is now 1,248,295</li>
<li><a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2011/03/nyc-mta-ftw.html" target="_blank">NYC MTA</a> is doing really good work on encouraging an ecosystem around information to help riders with real time subway data</li>
</ul>
<p>It goes beyond just offering advice during hurricane season if you're in business continuity. The real attention is in streaming information, adding commentary, having explainers on call, and making it a topic landing site with live transmission and interaction at scheduled times.</p>
<p>Make yourself and your organization explaining the news newsworthy.</p>
<h2><strong>PR as a revenue generating center</strong></h2>
<p>Step one, <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2009/08/are-you-hiring-the-right-public-relations-candidates.html" target="_blank" title="Are You Hiring the Right Public Relations Candidates?">hire the right public relations candidates</a>. Ability to write, listen and interview, as well as multimedia experience should be part of it. Step two, analyze what is trending in the news and who is writing and talking about it. Step three, determine primary and secondary audiences.</p>
<p>Step four, experiment with a couple of different formats, depending on how big the story potential is, and what entry points you will be able to create for your audience. You could find that:</p>
<ul>
<li>your customers prefer a closed news channel and you could create an email subscription</li>
<li>prospects and channel partners like to see who's showing up to read and comment</li>
<li>journalists and bloggers prefer to have ready-to-use assets, and access to people on the fly</li>
<li>big news organizations like AP want the information boiled down to <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2008/01/readers-digest.html" target="_blank" title="Reader's Digest Gets Conversation">Reader's Digest</a> format</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. By thinking about audiences, you bring third parties to the conversation stream. Much of the focus has been on information <strong>stock -- press releases and impressions</strong>. Now you need to shift focus on <strong>flow -- the elements that influence the rate of change in news and attention</strong>.</p>
<p>That's where the money is -- immediacy.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <strong>downstream opportunities</strong> you have with your organizations to establish <strong>topical pages, employ explainers, and take advantage of the immediacy of a situation to attract attention</strong>. Part of your plan should be how to keep that attention and transfer it, with permission, to other activities.</p>
<p>Next week, we'll talk about upstream opportunities for PR professionals.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I'm not advocating you copy Charlie Sheen, just take a look at the format. Could you work on a <strong>topical landing page</strong> for your industry, like Mother Jones did for news stories? What kinds of internal permissions do you need to get going to build that format?</p>
<p>Start right now. You could be riding the next news cycle from your own .com.</p>

<h2><strong>Everyone is an "actor"<br></strong></h2>
<p>If you publish consistently to social networks, it becomes almost second nature to write what you're thinking about. Twitter, Facebook, and even LinkedIn encourage posting. They make it easy and addictive to send status reports.</p>

<p>Of course, it's a free world, and people have different settings in social. I have no problem at all with any of the posts I see online. And, in case I do, block, unfollow, delete, and overlook are all there to help, just like in real life social settings. Self-aware is a responsibility of the self, as the term indicates.</p>
<p>The stories in shows like Ally McBeal hit a nerve because life itself is often offbeat and frequently surreal.</p>
<h2><strong>Two kinds of irresistible temptations<br></strong></h2>
<p>Real life has a way of defaulting to opt-in. Online is not an alternative world with no consequences. The only way to opt-out of saying or doing something you'll regret is at the thinking stage -- you know, before posting.</p>
<p>Many people confessed to me that they would not say the same things in person or to someone's face. So why do they do it online?</p>
<p>There are two kinds of reactions. They both say by not saying. And since social networking -- and community management -- is so much about nuance, if you know what you're listening for, you will have a better chance at navigating relationships, and making connections, based upon what you learn.</p>
<p>They are at the opposite ends of a spectrum:</p>
<p>1) the overly optimistic, all encompassing, everyone is my friend, there is never a bad day under the sun and it's a wonderful life, always, which is hard to pull off, even in writing, when the heart and head are not in the same place;</p>
<p>2) and the all is totally normal and super, there is nothing wrong, after all it's business as usual kind of behavior that becomes hard to pull off when, in fact, the evidence paints quite a different picture.</p>
<p>The second reaction or behavior is the one we're used to calling inauthentic in business. We have years of practice in reading those tea leaves. The first one is harder to detect, because there is a bit more semantic evidence work you need to do on the way the information is shared. The clues are there.</p>
<p>In the conversational style of social networks, it gets interpreted as stronger signal. To the discerning anthropologist, it spells a different message. One for human, zero for technology. I would be shocked if even the most sophisticated machine could be that good to infer what is not said.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2007/03/the-sound-of-silence.html" target="_blank" title="the sound of silence">Silence</a> is information, and it can speak louder than words.</p>
<h2><strong>What it means for connections</strong></h2>
<p>Proceed with care. It's far more enjoyable to default to trust in human relationships. However, technology changes constantly, humans don't. Social networks create this gigantic speed dating environment where people collect potential mates, just because they can.</p>
<p>And there is tremendous opportunity and possibility tucked in there. Connections take time, though. So if you want to develop meaningful relationships, invest in them, find ways to meet people in person, and choose to pay attention to what is said, as well as what goes unsaid. Silence is golden, too.</p>
<p>What you don't say says a lot about you, after all.</p>

<h2><strong>What technology wants</strong></h2>
<p>I'm reading Kevin Kelly, whose recent TOC talk video I embedded in this post [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k08xsjjlNc&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank" title="TOC 2011: Kevin Kelly, &quot;Better than Free: How Value Is Generated in a Free Copy World&quot; ">YouTube version</a> 25:49]. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Technology-Wants-Kevin-Kelly/dp/0670022152?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=converagent-20" target="_blank" title="What Technology Wants">the book</a> (Amazon aff link), he articulates the question and problem he's trying to solve. There are many entry points in his research and argument.</p>
<p>Staying with the question long enough to form the proper frame of reference is key to understanding how the answers apply to tactical work. You will also appreciate how he <strong>supports theses with evidence</strong>, even if you might have a different point of view and reference.</p>
<p>The material offers new options for consideration in a very fluid and ever changing field. Particularly around generating, his sixth verb that describes things people will pay for and cannot be copied, consider the role of:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>immediacy </strong>-- would you pay for right now? How about if we add context, five new customers; a piece of information you need badly to close a deal; making that problem go away... also think of newsletters with fresh and timely analysis </li>
<li><strong>personalization</strong> -- would you pay to have personalized medicine, for example?</li>
<li><strong>authenticity</strong> -- people do pay for the real deal in art, collecting, design, fashion, I could go on... why not pay for the real deal in communications and execution? (we'll come back to this concept in another post)</li>
<li><strong>attention</strong> -- is what you're paying now for attention giving you the desired results? What would you pay to get those?</li>
<li><strong>interpretation</strong> -- some common ground with my thoughts on <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2011/02/open-to-interpretation.html" target="_blank" title="Open to interpretation">open to interpretation</a>. It's really up to your customer to write the last part of the right now narrative from  their own  needs and experience. But once this happens, the story will  become  memorable in ways that turn customers into the next tier of   storytellers</li>
<li><strong>accessibility</strong> -- early in my career, I interviewed for a position at the Italian Mission to the United Nations. They required living in Manhattan, to be on call. Think about how people pay for access in leases, rentals, and services</li>
<li><strong>embodiment</strong> --I think of this as the experience, what happens at the <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2010/10/customer-service-made-simple.html" target="_blank" title="customer service made simple">Ritz Carlton</a>, for example, that would not happen in other hotels; or a concert, where you may have the same music, different performance</li>
<li><strong>findability</strong> -- in fact, connecting people with what they are looking for, which is especially powerful when they are not sure of what that is. There is very helpful reference on filters and aggregators in <em>The Long Tail</em> by Chris Anderson. </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the role of these needs in your business product or service lines - and make it easy to pay you to get them. Kelly reminds us that where attention goes, money will follow. He calls them generatives because they have to be generated in context, they cannot be copied, which makes them valuable.</p>
<h2>Unexplored opportunities</h2>
<p>In understanding what technology gives us, we also need to be mindful of what it wants of us. The unexplored opportunities in online influence ride on us identifying the levers, as well as creating or seeing the proper context for them to work.</p>
<p>Calculating what content someone tweets or posts to Facebook, and using their follower/fan counts in the same manner as subscription numbers and viewers for mainstream media is not going to give you ROI. You know also why? Because you are spending an awful lot of time demanding "return" without putting proper thought into defining "investment," in addition to resolving for context.</p>
<p>Is it possible, then, that instead of working on proving and disproving whether there is online influence, the question now is "ask another way"?</p>

The Swedish company 's secret to success, even in a market downturn, are its lean operations, tight controls, and shrewd tax planning, as reported in an article by The Economist. In fact, in the fiscal year 2010, IKEA’s sales grew by 7.7% to €23.1 billion and net profit increased by 6.1% to €2.7 billion. The company celebrated more than sixty years of "providing light, airy, functional Scandinavian style." Anyone in the retail business will be able to tell you, it's a tough world out there -- costs can be high, margins are low, range, service and product availability need to be maintained at the highest level for the company to make it. Like many other businesses, IKEA survives on satisfied customers. In June 2004, at one of Fast Company network's conversations in Philadelphia, we had the fortune of discussing the human side of the company's business with Pernille Lopez, then* President and CEO of IKEA North America.

<p>The tightly packaged furniture you buy at IKEA -- a company whose  business was founded on the idea that it is possible to offer a wide  range of well-designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so  low that they are affordable to as many people as possible -- is the  platform to a highly sustainable and successful business.</p>
<p>The Swedish company 's <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18229400" target="_blank">secret to success</a>, even in a market downturn, are its lean operations, tight controls, and shrewd tax planning, as reported in an article by <em>The Economist</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, in the fiscal year 2010, IKEA’s sales grew by 7.7% to €23.1 billion and net profit increased by 6.1% to €2.7 billion. The company celebrated more than sixty years of "providing light, airy, functional Scandinavian  style."</p>
<p>Anyone in the retail business will be able to tell you, it's a tough  world out there -- costs can be high, margins are low, range, service  and product availability need to be maintained at the highest level for  the company to make it. Like many other businesses, IKEA survives on  satisfied customers.</p>
<p>In June 2004, at one of <em>Fast Company</em> network's conversations  in Philadelphia, we had the fortune of discussing the human side of the  company's business with Pernille Lopez, then* President and CEO of <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/about_ikea/splash.html" target="_blank">IKEA North America</a>.  We met in Plymouth Meeting, PA, the location of their flagship and  first store in the US, and one of my favorite hunts for years.</p>
<p>The company was created by <strong>I</strong>ngvar <strong>K</strong>amprad from <strong>E</strong>lmtaryd in the rural parish of <strong>A</strong>gunnaryd;  looks familiar? That's where the name IKEA came from. Ivgar registered  it in 1943, at the age of 17 and soon after published the first catalog,  which sold the new sensation of the day: the ball point pen. As the  story goes, mail-order became milk-order -- it was the milkman who  delivered the products along his route. Some history on the company's  growth:</p>
<p><a href="http://conversationagent.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/ikeasgrowth_1_1.gif" target="_blank"><img alt="Ikeasgrowth_1_1" border="0" height="329" src="http://conversationagent.typepad.com/conversation_agent/images/ikeasgrowth_1_1.gif" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Ikeasgrowth_1_1" width="447"></img></a>The  heart and soul of IKEA was inspired by stone walls visible all over  southern Sweden -- a very rocky land that had to be cleared of stones to  be farmed.</p>
<p>People said it couldn't be done, the farmers living in this  area, Smalanders, did it and built the walls as they cleared the land.  This is the spirit that inspires the company to do things that other  people feel can't be done.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/about_ikea/facts_figures/ikea_is_organized.html" target="_blank">Ingvar Kamprad</a> built the business based upon 9 guiding principles, which the company today calls <strong>The Nine Points</strong>. This is the platform on which the business stands to this day [source: IKEA booklet titled "A Better Everyday Life"]:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Product Range -- Our identity</strong>: a wide range of home furnishings at prices so low that the many people can afford to buy them. </li>
<li><strong>The IKEA spirit -- a strong and living reality</strong>:  the true IKEA spirit is founded on our enthusiasm, our  cost-consciousness, willingness to assume responsibility and to help; on  our humbleness and simplicity in our behavior. We must take care of and  inspire each other. </li>
<li><strong>Profit gives us resources</strong>:  a better everyday life for the many people! To reach our goal we need  resources. This forces us to develop products economically, to purchase  better, and cut costs. </li>
<li><strong>To reach good results with small means</strong>:  expensive solutions to all kinds of problems are often signs of  mediocrity. Waste of resources is a "mortal sin" at IKEA. An idea  without a price tag is not acceptable. </li>
<li><strong>Simplicity is a virtue</strong>:  complicated rules can paralyze. Planning is necessary, but it can  become red tape. Exaggerated planning can be fatal. Let simplicity and  common sense guide you. </li>
<li><strong>The different way</strong>: by daring to be different, we find new ways. "Why" is a keyword. A hunger to experiment leads our way. </li>
<li><strong>Concentrating our energy -- key to our success</strong>:  we cannot do everything everywhere at the same time. We can't satisfy  all tastes nor conquer all markets at once. Concentrate your energy.  You'll get results. </li>
<li><strong>To assume responsibility -- a privilege</strong>:  only when sleeping one makes no mistakes. Mistakes are the privilege of  the active person who can start over and put things straight. Fear of  mistakes is the root of bureaucracy and the enemy of evolution. </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Most things remain to be done. A glorious future!</strong> A feeling of accomplishment can be a sleeping pill. You can do a lot in  10 minutes. Split your life into 10 minute segments and waste as few as  possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Platt, as in platform: Democratic Design</strong></h3>
<p>People have curves; materials matter; fashion's fun; comfort is key;  color is personal; everyone is not rich. Have you ever been at an IKEA  store? The designs are truly comfortable and beautiful. Form may be a  matter of lines and curves, materials and color, but it's also about  you.</p>
<p>Maybe you have seen one of the few IKEA TV commercials: a couple is  having a discussion in a well lit and colorful living room, the  expressions fly, the people are quite animated and you have no idea of  what this is about, until the camera's angle widens and you see that  you're in an IKEA showroom. In fact, what IKEA sells is who they are,  which brings me to the substance of our conversation with Pernille Lopez  on the human side of business decisions.</p>
<h3><strong>Platt, as in platform: The Human Side</strong></h3>
<p>Originally from Denmark and a journalist by training, Lopez learned  about the retail business by copying IKEA and while doing that, learned  her first big lesson: <strong>when you copy, you don't know what's behind</strong>.  She subsequently joined the Scandinavia furniture company in California  and quickly rose to Human Resources (HR) Manager for North America with  a seat on the global project team responsible for creating an HR  strategy.</p>
<p>In 2001, she became President of IKEA North America and had thus the opportunity to learn her second big lesson: <strong>living the reality of one's own strategies is tough</strong>.  Lopez was now grappling with her own decisions from a different  position within the company. Some of them concerning her most valuable  asset: part time employees. And since IKEA is a company where leaders  lead by example, all eyes were on her.</p>
<p>She was rescued by a company vision that has guided it through the  years allowing it to give down-to-earth, straightforward people the  possibility to grow, both as individuals and in their professional  roles. The realization was that it takes a dream to make a successful  business idea and it takes people to make dreams a reality.</p>
<p>Lopez believes that the role of business is changing. To provide  jobs, create profits and pay taxes is no longer enough. Our customers  and co-workers expect more from us. <strong>They expect us also to take an active role in influencing both social and environmental issues were we are present</strong>.  IKEA has developed a strong policy with respects to social  environmental responsibility so that it can be a good business and do  good as they feel responsible to do both.</p>
<p>IKEA's global workforce counts nearly 80,000 people who need health  insurance and opportunities to grow. The recruitment process begins with  a matching of values along with the competence assessment. There's a  movement around unleashing everyone's potential and looking at what's  holding people back. The 7 areas of development for IKEA coworkers are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Values </li>
<li>Open environment (transparency) </li>
<li>Mobility (support) </li>
<li>Diversity </li>
<li>Life balance </li>
<li>Learning and development (how to get there) </li>
<li>Leadership and culture (what makes you feel alive) </li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Platt, as in platform: to be Flat out Honest</strong></h3>
<p>"Why am I so infrequently the person I truly am?" Asked Lopez in the  framework of personal leadership. What does it take to answer the  questions on what you're about? During our conversation, we discovered  that it takes:</p>
<p><strong>Courage</strong> -  There are no clear answers. It is about being the front and trying to  find the way; taking steps that no one else is taking. Taking feedback  truly and asking of oneself: what are the things we're not dealing with?  The leader is responsible to create an environment where it's OK to ask  that. It's about dealing with the ugly, which won't go away. Courage is  addressing emotional issues such as diversity. It can be admitting that  it can be confusing as hell. It's about the excitement of fast change.  It's about taking risks and overcoming fears.</p>
<p>Some examples during recent events: the store in Elizabeth, NJ saw  the twin towers crash to the ground; IKEA was involved in the blackout  with their store in Canada and feared for its employees and customers at  the store in Washington, D.C. during the sniper attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Passion</strong> -  Pernille loves to sit and talk with people. Coaching and mentoring  takes 90% of her time. She loves connecting with what IKEA does. If you  express what you want, you may get it. Her great sense of urgency  demonstrates her love of retail. Diversity is a personal commitment - in  many situations she's been the only woman at the table. In many jobs  people need help to achieve greater opportunities. Passion creates  energy around you.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment</strong> - It must come from everything you have. It's not giving up, ever.  Towards friends, family, Copenhagen and the little town near it where  she's from. It means going all the way when people are struggling. It's  true when you're going through tough times. It's committing to having  life balance for yourself and everyone else. Through mentoring where  someone else drives the process and you learn to let them find a way.</p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong> -  This is everything. Trust is something she considers a given, you don't  have to earn it. You then take the responsibility when it's taken away.  This creates a great dynamic and level of empowerment. It stems from  knowing that she performed the best when she was trusted. 99% of the  people really want to do a good job. Trust sets people free to do that.  What it means to be a leader, personally and as an organization, is  being present, authentic, open, and creating an environment where other  people can be themselves.</p>
<p>What does IKEA say to other companies? They say: take our ideas,  please.</p>
<h3><strong>Platt, as in Platform: Social Media </strong></h3>
<p>I realize I could almost write a book, except for they have  written the book themselves; by being who they are, and doing what they  are. Is it any wonder that they have a <a href="http://www.positivefanatics.com/" target="_blank">passionate following</a>? Would it surprise you to find out there is at least one IKEA <a href="http://ikeahacker.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">hacker</a> and thousands of <a href="http://ikeafans.com/" target="_blank">IKEA fans</a>? IKEA was also one of the first nominated <a href="http://www.lovemarks.com/index.php?pageID=20015&amp;lovemarkid=163" target="_blank">lovemarks</a>.</p>
<p>In 2007, IKEA launched a user-generated bed making video campaign, hosted and managed by new entrant Shycast. </p>
<p>On the sustainability side, in 2008 the company made the commitment of cutting its plastic bags  from 70 to 35 million. It achieved a current 92 percent reduction before  moving to using no  plastic bags at all.</p>
<p>In 2009, decided to utilize the existing function of tagging photos in Facebook  to run a <a href="http://www.justinparks.com/ikea-get-social-media-creative-with-viral-marketing-facebook/" target="_blank" title="Ikea get Social Media creative with viral marketing on Facebook">branding and buzz exercise</a> around the Malmö store manager, Gordon Gustavsson and the new store opening in the area. By doing that, they also created a halo effect for the brand, and associated it with people's own profiles.</p>
<p>The company's Twitter presences are a bit all over the place, with <a href="http://twitter.com/IKEAITALIA" target="_blank">IKEAITALIA</a> in first search place -- I do know the store is loved back home -- and no clear naming conventions, although <a href="http://twitter.com/ikeafans" target="_blank">its fans</a> appear to match. <a href="http://twitter.com/IKEAUSA" target="_blank">This</a> must be a first that Italy is ahead of the US in social media, at least on Twitter.</p>
<p>With 231,115 fans on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/IKEAUSA" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, the US stores gain the advantage and conversation on the wall. Check out the photeos, too. There are some that are priceless, even at IKEA's rates.</p>
<p>Its furniture may be flat, yet the company's growth is everything but. We could have so much fun in social with this brand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">* While Ms. Pernille-Lopez is no longer the President of IKEA North America, I felt that revisiting the company's philosophy would be useful in understanding the context that has made its social media efforts fun and engaging.

<p>Many blogs are not thinking like publications, others are just blog versions of marketing material, press releases, or technical bulletins <strong>in intent and language</strong>.</p>
<p>Becoming a platform means becoming the go to destination for a certain subject matter in the industry, examining the offerings of many companies, and discussing industry trends  in a geographic area, for example.</p>
<p>Who does this well? Usually independent  consultants. It takes an enterprising person who plays well with  everyone to get the market ecosystem integration done well.</p>
<p>And here we discussed how you can start <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2010/05/build-an-online-platform-move-past-the-article-to-the-topic.html" target="_blank" title="Build an Online Platform: Move Past the Article to the Topic">moving past the article to the topic</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Who cares for your industry?</strong></h2>
<p>You do, and you should show that.</p>
<p>Don't read the memos that say blogs are done with, there is plenty of opportunity for the voice of the corporation to be heard. And with all the special interest groups, shareholders, the politics, and the rest that happens to make noise and weaken the business, it is about time it speaks back.</p>
<p>I talk with many young entrepreneurs, students who are starting consultancies and product companies, and I know, I hear where businesses start from. There is a ton of energy invested in doing what people do. In some cases, putting a lot of time into it.</p>
<p>For them, the way they articulate it, it was never a question of finding their passion, it found them. They care about the industry they're in, meet with others, stay on top of what's happening, know what they want to make happen.</p>
<p>This is the best way to literally build industry conversations and market ecosystem. Look at what happened to social media only in a few years.</p>
<h2><strong>When organizations grow</strong></h2>
<p>There are all kinds of complications that many more mature organizations face. The most glaring of them all is its inability to communicate and connect with people. Corporate blogs are a way for the business to find its voice again.</p>
<p>They are not "the cost of doing business." The point of being an organization is to set the tone on industry conversations. I'm seeing encouraging evidence in the health-related industry lately. Maybe because I have been working with that crowd.</p>
<p>Topics like <a href="http://www.discussdiabetes.com/" target="_blank" title="sanofi aventis">discuss diabetes</a>, <a href="http://www.ahealthiermichigan.org/" target="_blank" title="Blue Cross, Blue Shield of Michigan">a healthier Michigan</a> are off to a good start. We Talked about Mayo Clinic <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2010/07/leading-an-industry-mayo-clinic-rolls-out-center-for-social-media.html" target="_blank" title="Leading an Industry: Mayo Clinic Rolls out Center for Social Media">leading an industry with the center for social media</a>. These examples take you closer to what the business cares about, and no doubt, when thought through, they will help those businesses become more resilient.</p>
<p>When organizations grow, they forget about the very reasons that made them great. The clear signal they used to connect them to their customers is lost or confused. Which is why many talk in unnatural sound bites.</p>
<p>The point of starting a blog is to find your way into industry conversations again, to lead the market ecosystem around your business. Engagement, views, all that other good stuff comes when the business finds its voice again. And when it does have a voice, it can speak authoritatively again.</p>

<h3>Why own when you can rent?</h3>
<p>Renting an apartment in the area and going back and forth was a preferable solution to moving the whole family -- arranging for new schools, and a successful career for the spouse were not on the table. I also discovered that both he and his wife leased cars.</p>
<p>The experience of driving newer cars trumped owning older models for them. When the company assignment ended, it was fairly easy to move to another market. Low impact for the family not needing to move a couple of times.</p>
<p>Renting vs. owning was what we did in Italy, at least a few years back that was the case.</p>
<p>It was in the US that I noticed how much stuff people actually buy and own. I thought garages were for cars, used goods were for antiques markets in piazzas vs. private driveways, and only people who were moving unexpectedly rented storage spaces.</p>
<p>Certainly people don't accumulate things just for sport, there are advantages to owning -- convenience and choice being big ones, for example. Owning is not going to go away any time soon. And the economic system relies heavily upon people buying more and regularly, still. That is changing, though.</p>
<h3>What if you don't have to give up choice?</h3>
<p>In a market of abundance, like we have today, many of the advantages to ownership -- having something when you need it, choosing your own colors, fabrics, places, etc. -- thanks to ubiquitous nature of technology and digital tools, transfer to temporary use.</p>
<p><a href="http://trendwatching.com/trends/11trends2011/#ownerless" target="_blank">Owner-less has been a trend</a> for quite a few years. First at the edges, and in environments that responded to the call for sustainability and conservation. Then becoming more mainstream for several reasons outlined by Trendwatching (emphasis mine):</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional ownership implies a certain level of  responsibility, cost and commitment. <strong>Consumers looking for convenience  and collecting as many experiences as possible</strong> want none of these  things. </li>
<li>Fractional ownership and leasing lifestyle businesses offer  the possibility of perpetual upgrades to the latest and greatest, the  ability to <strong>maximize the number and variety of experiences, and allow  consumers to access otherwise out-of-reach luxuries</strong>. </li>
<li>Owning bulky, irregularly used items is both expensive and  unsustainable, especially in dense urban environments where space is at a  premium. With <strong>more consumers having mobile access to online systems, it  becomes easier to book items whenever and wherever they are needed</strong>-- renting a place or an item can now be done also by sharing with other people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about how much we rely on cloud computing and online storage for networking, sharing documents, and getting things done with virtual teams. </p>
<p>As consumers, we are getting used to streaming videos on Netflix, TV programming on Hulu, and booking transportation with Zipcar. Last night you could watch the Oscars online, if you were willing to sign up for a few dollars at the .com site. Or you could read them on Twitter from peers.</p>
<p>Your customers may have decided to own less, however that probably means they are looking to experience more. What kinds of services and products do you have, or how can you rethink your portfolio and service pipeline to leverage your assets and provide more access?</p>

<p>It's a serious question. Take a moment to think about it.</p>
<p>I'm in awe of business owners. It takes courage to step forward and start a business. Many of my friends run a solopreneur, consultancy, or a small business.</p>

<p>Gini Dietrich often collects articles and posts helpful to small business owners. This <a href="http://www.spinsucks.com/social-media/gin-and-topics-get-a-job/" target="_blank">week's top five</a> caught my eye.</p>
<p>The lead story is filed under "you're the boss" in the <em>New York Times</em>, and judging from the comments, it does an excellent job at raising your blood pressure if you're a communications professional, just like the <a href="http://ff.im/yQmc6" target="_blank" title="I prefer to link to the thread with comments from different perspectives at various stages of thinking">recent posts</a> by Fred Wilson if you're in marketing.</p>
<p>It seems that taking shots at the marketing and communication profession has become the way to get desired news coverage and reactions online -- a sport of sorts.</p>
<p>I was not familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Buschel" target="_blank">Bruce Buschel</a>, although I can appreciate his writing style from reading his blog. From the short Wikipedia entry, it seems he has a flair for incisive commentary. With fork in hand, now that he is a restaurant owner. No doubt, Buschel has received his fair share of pitches over the years.</p>
<p>Hard for me to know Mr. Buschel's intentions. However, if I were to take an educated guess, the post achieves a couple of goals -- it kills two birds with one stone, so to speak. It gets him nice coverage for the restaurant, it gives him an opportunity to get back at PR flacks, while it link baits traffic to the site.</p>
<p><strong>It takes, without giving much back</strong>, just yet.</p>
<p>The problem with assumptions, of course, is that they are just that. I'm telling you a story based upon my interpretation of a situation. The problem with assumptions is also that they paint facts and people with a very broad brush, and once they gain the first mover advantage and get a reaction, the goals are met. The job is done, and so is the harm.</p>
<p>My own take on the situation described is that it takes two people to make a disconnect happen. It takes a bigger person to recognize one, acknowledge it, including the role they played -- hence why the answer on whether you like yourself matters -- and reconcile any balances upset in the process.</p>
<p>An opportunity missed in this case, it seems.</p>
<p>Not to worry though, Mr. Buschel announces he has a solution for his next post. A breath of fresh air, I'm sure. And a much needed change for an industry that doesn't know what it's doing. If only we had had a hero rescuing it. If only we had energetic writing to set the record straight.</p>
<p>The problem with assumptions is that they skip the whole critical thinking process in favor of just critical. Satisfaction, however, is hollow when it doesn't meet its own true motivation.</p>

The event was large enough and yet intimate enough for us to connect with several people between sessions. Kudos to those organizers for utilizing the venue and designing the program well. I love meeting people in person, and do take the extra steps to stay in touch over time. You may be able to hide behind something you leverage online. There's no hiding in real life. Your assets must be real. Just like in business, eventually you will be found. The good news is that once you make a connection real, you have it for a long time. I was reminded of that this week when I had the good fortune of catching up with journalist and new media maven Alison Woo and reconnecting with a long time friend on the train back -- what are the chances someone would get on a train with several cars and see you?

<p>Among the speakers were Tim Ferriss, the event keynote who geeked us up on search and evergreen content, and Anil Dash, who was on a panel later in the day.</p>
<p>The event was large enough and yet intimate enough for us to <strong>connect with several people</strong> between sessions. Kudos to those organizers for utilizing the venue and designing the program well.</p>
<p>I love meeting people in person, and do take the extra steps to stay in touch over time. You may be able to hide behind something you leverage online.</p>
<p><strong>There's no hiding in real life</strong>. Your assets must be real. Just like in business, eventually you will be found. The good news is that once you make a connection real, you have it for a long time.</p>
<p>I was reminded of that this week when I had the good fortune of catching up with journalist and new media maven <a href="http://alisonwoo.com/bio/" target="_blank">Alison Woo</a> and reconnecting with a long time friend on the train back -- what are the chances someone would get on a train with several cars and see you?</p>
<p>There are many more of these examples I could give you going back in time. To me, the gold in relationships is still face to face, handshake-type promises. Which is why it is so <strong>important to learn to transform your presentations and interviews into conversations</strong>. So you can open that door.</p>
<p>It's not just the visuals on the deck, it's the delivery and your own availability to making those connections -- body language, and attitude. All great sales people know that (disclosure: my mother was in sales, the best I've seen, and I've worked with many).</p>
<p>Since I do not make a mystery of <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/conversation-agent-social-networks-participation-policy.html" target="_blank">how I use social networks</a>, I am always quite surprised when people send the standard LinkedIn invite when we haven't even crossed paths. Please, do not tell me that being a member of a group with a gazillion others qualifies as having something in common. Or that we have done business together at a company I have not heard about. You know better.</p>
<p>And you know that signing me up for your newsletter doesn't mean I was interested... yet.</p>
<h2><strong>Ripples and connections</strong></h2>
<p>What works on LinkedIn, as in real life, are personal introductions. The act of shaking someone's hand, looking them in the eye, taking in the non verbals within the context where you are, including the common contact, bind you in ways a social graph can only demonstrate *after* that connection is established.</p>
<p>When David Armano published the influence ripples graphic, we discussed how online was only a fraction of the connections many people had in real life. Although I have been using Twitter steadily for about four years, projects and opportunities are still flowing through a network you cannot see -- my address book.</p>
<p>If online we still conduct paying business through search, <strong>emails, phone calls, or in person meetings are the best conversion tools for individual connections</strong>. <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2006/08/influence.html" target="_blank">Stephen Downes</a> wrote that influence is not a function of linkage. It's a function of:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. <strong>Diversity</strong> - a person who communicates with a diverse audience will be  more influential than a person who communicates with a uniform  audience.<br><br>2. <strong>Autonomy </strong>- a person who is free to speak his or her  own mind, and is not merely parroting some 'official view', will have  more influence.<br><br>3. <strong>Openness</strong> - a person who writes in multiple  languages, or who can be read on multiple platforms, or who is not  limited to a single communications channel, will have more influence.<br><br>4.  <strong>Connectivity</strong> - a person you can communicate with, and who will listen  to your point of view, will have more influence than a person who does  not.</p>
<p>Because I grew up and completed my studies in a country, in three languages, then moved to a different country, where I worked in five industries, and also attended university and many industry accreditation programs, built a social network with live events, traveled extensively for work, and am a very curious and interested individual, I know a lot of different people in many fields. As for the question of influence, I let <em>the influenced</em> decide that.</p>
<p>We are very lucky to live in a country where we can speak freely, be open, seek diversity, and think critically. A good reason to stop seeking links, and start making connections.</p>
